[617. Merge Two Binary Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/)

* Apple, Huawei
* Tree

Merge Rules:
1. If two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node;
2. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new Tree.

## Method 1. My Solution, Recursion
```java 
class Solution {
    public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2) {
        if(t1 == null && t2 == null) {
            return null;
        }
        if(t1 == null) {
            return mergeTrees(t2, t1);
        }
        // t1 is not null, 
        t1.val = t1.val + (t2 == null ? 0 : t2.val);
        t1.left = (t2 == null) ? t1.left : mergeTrees(t1.left, t2.left);
        t1.right = (t2 == null) ? t1.right : mergeTrees(t1.right, t2.right);
        
        return t1;
    }
}
```


## Method 2. Using Recursion
1. At every step, we check if the current node exits (i.e. not null) for both the trees. If so, we add the values in the current nodes of both the trees and update the value in the current node of the first tree to reflect this sum obtained.
2. At every step, we also call the original function `mergeTrees()` with the left children and then with the right children of the current nodes of the two trees.
3. If at any step, one of these children happens to be null, we return the child of the other tree.
```java 
class Solution {
    public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2) {
        if(t1 == null) {
            return t2;
        }
        if(t2 == null) {
            return t1;
        }
        t1.val += t2.val;
        t1.left = mergeTrees(t1.left, t2.left);
        t1.right = mergeTrees(t1.right, t2.right);
        
        return t1;
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis

    Time complexity : O(m). A total of m nodes need to be traversed. Here, m represents the minimum number of nodes from the two given trees.
    Space complexity : O(m). The depth of the recursion tree can go upto m in the case of a skewed tree. In average case, depth will be O(logm).


## Method 2. Iteration
```java 
class Solution {
    public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2) {
        if(t1 == null) {    
            return t2;
        }   // t1 is not null
        
        Stack<TreeNode[]> stack = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(new TreeNode[]{t1, t2});
        while(!stack.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode[] t = stack.pop();
            if(t[0] == null || t[1] == null) {
                continue;
            }
            t[0].val += t[1].val;
            if(t[0].left == null) {     // if t[0].left is null, then t[0].left = t[1].left, 
                t[0].left = t[1].left;
            } else {
                stack.push(new TreeNode[]{t[0].left, t[1].left});
            }
            if(t[0].right == null) {    // if t[0].left is null, then t[0].left = t[1].left, therefore, in the stack, `t[0]` cannot be null
                t[0].right = t[1].right;
            } else {
                stack.push(new TreeNode[]{t[0].right, t[1].right});
            }
        }
        return t1;
    }
}
```

Complexity Analysis

    Time complexity : O(n). We traverse over a total of n nodes. Here, n refers to the smaller of the number of nodes in the two trees.
    Space complexity : O(n). The depth of stack can grow upto n in case of a skewed tree.
