> The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the **longest** path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.      
> The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

## Method 1. Depth-First Search

          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5  

helper(null) ==> return 0
helper(4)    ==> return 0
helper(2)    ==> return 1

> Intuition:        
> Any path can be written as two **arrows** (in different directions) from some nodes, where an arrow is a path that starts at some node and only travels down to child nodes.

```java 
class Solution {
    
    private int res = 0;
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        helper(root);
        return res;
    }
    
    private int helper(TreeNode node) {
        if(node == null) {  // If this node is null, then there is no edge between node and its parent
            return 0;
        }
        int left = helper(node.left);
        int right = helper(node.right);
        res = Math.max(res, left + right);
        return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis

    Time Complexity: O(N). We visit every node once.
    Space Complexity: O(N), the size of our implicit call stack during our depth-first search.
