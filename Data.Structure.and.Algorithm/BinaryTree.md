The common strategies to traverse a Tree data structure are Breadth-First Search (a.k.a BFS) and Depth-First Search (a.k.a. DFS). The DFS strategy can be further distinguished as preorder DFS, inorder DFS and postorder DFS, depending on the relative order of visit among the node itself and its child nodes.


## 1. Binary Tree


## 2. Binary Search Tree (BST)
Properties of a BST:
1. Left subtree of a node `N` contains nodes whose values are lesser than or equal to node `N`'s value.
2. Right subtree of a node `N` contains nodes whose values are greater than node `N`'s value.
3. Both left and right subtrees are also BSTs.


:warning:注意: BT and BST 是不同的，BST有序。
