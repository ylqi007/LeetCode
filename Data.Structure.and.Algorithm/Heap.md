A heap is a very powerful data structure that allows us to efficiently find the maximum or minimum value in a dynamic dataset.

* In a **Min-Heap** the key present at the root node must be less than or equal among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree. In a Min-Heap the minimum key element present at the root. 在Min-Heap中，root node是最小元素。
* In a **Max-Heap** the key present at the root node must be greater than or equal among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree. In a Max-Heap the maximum key element present at the root. 在Max-Heap中，root node是最大元素。
