## Method 1
> Instead of searching from an empty room to the gates, how about searching the other way round? 
> In other words, we initiate breadth-first search (BFS) from all gates at the same time. 
> Since BFS guarantees that we search all rooms of distance d before searching rooms of distance d + 1, 
> the distance to an empty room must be the shortest.

```java
class Solution {
    private static final int INF = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    private static final int GATE = 0;
    private static final int[][] DIRS = {{-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}}; // up, right, down left
    
    public void wallsAndGates(int[][] rooms) {
        if(rooms==null || rooms.length==0) {
            return;
        }
        
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<int[]>();
        // Initialize the queue, add all gates into the queue
        for(int i=0; i<rooms.length; i++) {
            for(int j=0; j<rooms[0].length; j++) {
                if(rooms[i][j] == GATE) {
                    queue.offer(new int[]{i, j});
                }
            }
        }
        
        // BFS
        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] point = queue.poll();
            for(int[] dir: DIRS) {
                int row = point[0] + dir[0];
                int col = point[1] + dir[1];
                if(row<0 || row>=rooms.length || col<0 || col>=rooms[0].length || rooms[row][col]!=INF) {
                    continue;
                }
                rooms[row][col] = rooms[point[0]][point[1]] + 1;
                queue.offer(new int[]{row, col});
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* `room[x][y]` represents its minimum distance to a gate;
    * `room[x][y] == 0`, i.e. itself is a gate and the minimum distance to a gate it 0.

在 `queue` 中靠前的部分的 point 到 `GATE=0` 的距离最小，因此基于靠前部分更新的距离就是最小的距离。
再者，距离更新完之后就不再变化了，因为更新完之后就不再是 `INF` 了，所以也不在变化了。

Complexity analysis

    Time complexity : O(mn). If you are having difficulty to derive the time complexity, start simple. Let us start with the case with only one gate. The breadth-first search takes at most m×n steps to reach all rooms, therefore the time complexity is O(mn). But what if you are doing breadth-first search from k gates?
    Once we set a room's distance, we are basically marking it as visited, which means each room is visited at most once. Therefore, the time complexity does not depend on the number of gates and is O(mn).

    Space complexity : O(mn). The space complexity depends on the queue's size. We insert at most m×n points into the queue.
