### 20200701: Review of Basic Calculators

Review of the following questoins:
1. 224.Basic Calculator
2. 227.Basic Calculator II
3. 772.Basic Calculator III

### 20200702: Clone-related problems
1. 133.Clone Graph
2. 138.Copy List with Random Pointer
3. 1485.Clone Binary Tree with Random Pointer
4. 1490.Clone N-ary Tree

* 用 HashMap 标记已经访问过的 or 复制过的 node，从而避免陷入死循环。
* 在 `1485. Clone Binary Tree with Random Pointer` 中，需要有 `HashMap` 来标记已经访问过的 Nodes。
* 然而在 `1490. Clone N-ary Tree` 中，并不需要 `HashMap`，只要简单的 DFS 就可以。这是因为 `1490` 是普通的 Tree，没有 `random`，因此不会有循环的产生。
