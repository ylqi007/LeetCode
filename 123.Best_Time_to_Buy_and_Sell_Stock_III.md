> If one can make one transaction (i.e. buy and sell once), then better to make this **bet** count. 
> The best strategy would be to *buy* at the **lowest** and then *sell* at the **highest** price. 
> To put it simple, **buy low and sell high**.
>
> On the other hand, if one can make as many transactions as one would like, then in order to gain the maximal profits,
> one must *capture* each **augmentation** and *avoid* each **plunging** of stock price.

> You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time, (i.e. you must sell the stock before you buy again).        
> We could interpret this constraint as that there would be **no overlapping** in the sequence of transactions.
>
> Now, if we divide the sequence of prices around the element at the index `i`, into two subsequences, 
> with left subsequences as `Prices[0], Prices[1], ... Prices[i]` and the right subsequence as `Prices[i+1], ... Prices[N-1]`, 
> then the total maximum profits that we obtain from this division (denoted as `max_profits[i]`) can be expressed as follows: `max_profits[i]=left_profits[i]+right_profits[i+1]`.

* Rather than constructing the two DP arrays in two separate loops, we do the calculation in a single loop (two birds with one stone). 
* We pad the `right_profits[i]` array with an additional zero, which indicates the maximum profits that we can gain from an empty right subsequence, so that we can compare the result of having only one transaction (i.e. `left_profits[N-1]`) with the profits gained from doing two transactions.

Complexity
1. Time Complexity: `O(N)` where NNN is the length of the input sequence, since we have two iterations of length N.
2. Space Complexity: `O(N)` for the two arrays that we keep in the algorithm. 
    
    
## Method 2. One-Pass Simulation
Key Points:
1. `t1Cost`, the **minimal** cost of buying the stock in transaction #1. The minimal cost to acquire a stock would be the minimal price value that we have seen so far at each step.
2. `t1Profit`, the **maximal** profit of selling the stock in transaction #1. Actually, at the end of the iteration, this value would be the answer for the first problem in the series, i.e. 121.Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock.
3. `t2Cost`, the **minimal** cost of buying the stock in transaction #2, while taking into account the profit gained from the previous transaction #1. One can consider this as the cost of reinvestment. Similar with t1_cost, we try to find the lowest price so far, which in addition would be partially compensated by the profits gained from the first transaction.
4. `t2Profit`, the **maximal** profit of selling the stock in transaction #2. With the help of t2_cost as we prepared so far, we would find out the maximal profits with at most two transactions at each step.

Notes: The reinvestment, i.e. we calculate the `t2Profit` exactly like `t1` at first, and then add `t1Profit` into `t2Profit`.
1. Without `t1Profit`, `t2Cost = Math.min(t2Cost, prices[i]), t2Profit = Math.max(prices[i] - t2Cost, t2Profit)`
2. With `t1Profit`, `t2Profit = Math.max(prices[i] - t2Cost + t1Profit, t2Profit) = Math.max(prices[i] - (t2Cost - t1Profit), t2Profit)`, then `t2Cost - t1Profit` has the same position as `t2Cost` in the equation without `t1Profit`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int t1Cost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int t2Cost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int t1Profit = 0;
        int t2Profit = 0;
        
        for(int price: prices) {
            // The maximum profit if only one transaction is allowed
            t1Cost = Math.min(t1Cost, price);
            t1Profit = Math.max(t1Profit, price - t1Cost);
            
            // Reinvest the grained profit in the second transaction
            t2Cost = Math.min(t2Cost, price - t1Profit);
            t2Profit = Math.max(t2Profit, price - t2Cost);
        }

        return t2Profit;
    }
}
```
Complexity
1. Time Complexity: `O(N)`, where NNN is the length of the input sequence.
2. Space Complexity: `O(1)`, only constant memory is required, which is invariant from the input sequence.
