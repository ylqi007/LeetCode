Key Points:     
1. The first idea is to use brute-force that means to generate all possible ways
to put `N` queens on the board, and then check them to keep only the combinations
with no queen under attack. This means `O(N^N)` time complexity and hence we'are
forced to think further how to optimize.
2. Related programming conceptions: **constrained programming**. This basically
means to put restrictions after each queen placement. One puts a queen on the board
and that immediately excludes one column, one row and two diagonals. 
也就是在每次放置一个queen之后添加一定的限制。 
3. Related programming conceptions: **backtracking**. 

## Method 1. Backtracking
Two tips:
1. There could be the only one queen in a row and the only one queen in a column.
That means that there is no need to consider all squares on the board. One could
just iterate over the columns. 也就是在每行、每列上有且仅有一个 queen。
2. For all "hill" diagonals `row + column = const`, and for all "dale" diagonals
`row - column = const`.
3. Backtracking algorithm function: `backtrack(row=0, count=0)`
  * Start from the first `row = 0`;
  * Iterate over the columns and try to put a queen in each `col`:
      * If square `(row, column)` is not under attack
          * Place the queen in `(row, col)` square;
          * Exclude one row, one column and two diagonals from further consideration.
          * **If** all rows are filled up, i.e. `row == N`
              * That means that we find out one more solultion, count++;
          * **Else**, i.e. this square is under attack
              * Proceed to place further queens `backtrack(row+1, count)`
          * Now backtrack: remove the queen from `(row, col)` square.

    public int totalNQueens(int n) {

        int[] hills = new int[4 * n - 1];   // hill diagonals
        int[] dales = new int[2 * n - 1];   // dale diagonals

                // Place queen
                rows[col] = 1;
                hills[row - col + 2 * n] = 1; // hill diagonals
                dales[row + col] = 1;       // dale diagonals
                
                if(row + 1 == n) {  // If a queens are already placed.
                    count++;
                } else {
                    count = backtracking(row + 1, count, n, rows, hills, dales);
                }
                // Remove queen
                rows[col] = 0;
                hills[row - col + 2 * n] = 0;
                dales[row + col] = 0;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    private boolean isNotUnderAttack(int row, int col, int n, int[] rows, int[] hills, int[] dales) {
        int res = rows[col] + hills[row - col + 2 * n] + dales[row + col];
        return (res == 0) ? true : false;
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis
1. Time complexity : `O(N!)`. There is `N` possibilities to put the first queen, not more than `N (N - 2)` to put the 
second one, not more than `N(N - 2)(N - 4)` for the third one etc. In total that results in `O(N!)` time complexity.
2. Space complexity : `O(N)` to keep an information about diagonals and rows.
