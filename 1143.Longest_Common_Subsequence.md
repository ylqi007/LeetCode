## Method 1. Dynamic Programming - My Solution
Key Points:
1. If `s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)`, then increment the length of common subsequence.
2. If `s.charAt(i) != t.charAt(j)`, delete one char from `s` or `t` to find the longest common subsequence.

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
        if(text1 == null || text2 == null || text1.length() == 0 || text2.length() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int M = text1.length();
        int N = text2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[M+1][N+1];
        for(int i=0; i<M; i++) {
            for(int j=0; j<N; j++) {
                if(text1.charAt(i) == text2.charAt(j)) {
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i][j] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = Math.max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[M][N];
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis
1. Time complexity : `O(M⋅N)`. We're solving `M⋅N` subproblems. Solving each subproblem is an `O(1)` operation.
2. Space complexity : `O(M⋅N)`. We'e allocating a 2D array of size `M⋅N` save the answers to subproblems.
