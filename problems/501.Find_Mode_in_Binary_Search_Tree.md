## Method 1. My Solution (9ms)
首先 inorder traversal 遍历整棵数，并用 Map 记录每个 value 出现的次数，并且记录次数最多的 value。

```java 
class Solution {
    private int max = 0;
    public int[] findMode(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) {
            return new int[0];
        }
        
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        helper(root, map);
        
        int[] res = new int[map.size()];
        int idx = 0;
        for(int key: map.keySet()) {
            if(map.get(key) == max) {
                res[idx++] = key;
            }
        }
        return Arrays.copyOf(res, idx);
    }
    
    private void helper(TreeNode node, Map<Integer, Integer> map) {
        if(node == null) {
            return;
        }
        
        helper(node.left, map);
        
        if(!map.containsKey(node.val)) {
            map.put(node.val, 1);
        } else {
            map.put(node.val, map.get(node.val) + 1);
        }
        max = Math.max(max, map.get(node.val));
        helper(node.right, map);
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
Given `n` as the number of nodes in the tree,
1. Time complexity: `O(n)`
    * During the DFS, we visit each node once. At each node, we perform `O(1)` work since hash map operations cost `O(1)`.
    * Next, we find `maxFreq`, which involves iterating over counter. In the worst case scenario where the tree has only unique values, counter will have a size of `n`, and thus this will cost `O(n)`.
    * Finally, we construct `ans`, which involves iterating over counter again. Overall, our time complexity is `O(n)`. In Java, we need to convert ans to the correct type, but this doesn't change the time complexity.
2. Space complexity: `O(n)`
    * During DFS, recursion is executed using the call stack. This call stack is equal to the depth of the tree, which in the worst case scenario is `O(n)`. Also, as mentioned above, if the tree only has unique values then counter will have a size of `n`. Thus, counter also uses `O(n)` space.


## Method 2. [Java 4ms Beats 100% Extra O(1) solution - No Map](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-mode-in-binary-search-tree/discuss/98100/java-4ms-beats-100-extra-o1-solution-no-map) (1ms)
[Reference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-mode-in-binary-search-tree/discuss/98101/Proper-O(1)-space)
与我的方法相比，这里也进行了遍历。通过一个 list 保存了出现频率最高的 values。

Follow up: Need no extra space.

```java 
public class Solution {
    Integer prev = null;
    int count = 1;
    int max = 0;
    public int[] findMode(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return new int[0];
        
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        traverse(root, list);
        
        int[] res = new int[list.size()];
        for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); ++i) res[i] = list.get(i);
        return res;
    }
    
    private void traverse(TreeNode root, List<Integer> list) {
        if (root == null) return;
        traverse(root.left, list);
        if (prev != null) {
            if (root.val == prev)
                count++;
            else
                count = 1;
        }
        if (count > max) {
            max = count;
            list.clear();
            list.add(root.val);
        } else if (count == max) {
            list.add(root.val);
        }
        prev = root.val;
        traverse(root.right, list);
    }
}
```

 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}

 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int[] findMode(TreeNode root) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> counter = new HashMap<>();
        Deque<TreeNode> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        stack.push(root);

        while(!stack.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode node = stack.pop();
            counter.put(node.val, counter.getOrDefault(node.val, 0) + 1);
            
            if(node.left != null) {
                stack.push(node.left);
            }
            if(node.right != null) {
                stack.push(node.right);
            }
        }

        int maxFreq = 0;
        for(int key: counter.keySet()) {
            maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq, counter.get(key));
        }

        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int key: counter.keySet()) {
            if(counter.get(key) == maxFreq) {
                ans.add(key);
            }
        }

        int[] res = new int[ans.size()];
        for(int i=0; i<ans.size(); i++) {
            res[i] = ans.get(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
}

## Method 4. Breadth First Search (BFS, with `Queue`)
```Java
/**

 *     int val;

 *     TreeNode right;

 */
class Solution {
    public int[] findMode(TreeNode root) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> counter = new HashMap<>();
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(root);
        int maxFreq = 0;

        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode node = queue.remove();

            counter.put(node.val, counter.getOrDefault(node.val, 0) + 1);
            maxFreq = Math.max(counter.get(node.val), maxFreq);
            if(node.left != null) {
                queue.add(node.left);
            }
            if(node.right != null) {
                queue.add(node.right);
            }
        }

        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int key: counter.keySet()) {
            if(counter.get(key) == maxFreq) {
                ans.add(key);
            }
        }

        int[] res = new int[ans.size()];
        for(int i=0; i<ans.size(); i++) {
            res[i] = ans.get(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

1. Time complexity: `O(n)`
    * During the BFS, we visit each node once. At each node, we perform `O(1)` work since hash map and queue operations cost `O(1)`. Note that this assumes that the implementation of queue is efficient. In the code we presented above, all implementations are efficient.
    * Next, we find `maxFreq`, which involves iterating over counter. In the worst-case scenario where the tree has only unique values, counter will have a size of nnn, and thus this will cost `O(n)`.
    * Finally, we construct `ans`, which involves iterating over counter again. Overall, our time complexity is `O(n)`. In Java, we need to convert ans to the correct type, but this doesn't change the time complexity.

## Method 5. No Hash-Map (5ms)
```Java
/**

 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;

 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int[] findMode(TreeNode root) {
        List<Integer> values = new ArrayList<>();
        dfs(root, values);

        int maxStreak = 0;
        int currStreak = 0;
        int currNum = 0;
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();

        for(int num: values) {
            if(num == currNum) {
                currStreak++;
            } else {
                currStreak = 1;
                currNum = num;
            }

            if(currStreak > maxStreak) {
                ans = new ArrayList<>();
                maxStreak = currStreak;
            }
            if(currStreak == maxStreak) {
                ans.add(num);
            }
        }

        int[] res = new int[ans.size()];
        for(int i=0; i<ans.size(); i++) {
            res[i] = ans.get(i);
        }
        return res;
    }

    private void dfs(TreeNode node, List<Integer> values) {
        if(node == null) {
            return;
        }
        // Inorder traversal visits nodes in sorted order
        dfs(node.left, values);
        values.add(node.val);
        dfs(node.right, values);
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
Given `n` as the number of nodes in the tree,
1. Time complexity: `O(n)`
    * During the DFS, we visit each node once. At each node, we perform `O(1)` work.
    * After the DFS, we iterate over values which has a length of nnn. At each iteration, we perform `O(1)` work. Overall, we perform `O(n)` work.
    * You may notice that the runtime of this algorithm is faster than the first three approaches. This is because while hash map operations are `O(1)`, the constant overhead still takes a little bit of time, especially compared to just using a list. In Java, we need to convert ans to the correct type, but this doesn't change the time complexity.
2. Space complexity: `O(n)`
    * During DFS, recursion is executed using the call stack. This call stack is equal to the depth of the tree, which in the worst-case scenario is `O(n)`. Also, the values array always grows to a size of nnn, and thus also uses `O(n)` space.
