[101. Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)


## Method 1. Recursive
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode root) {
        return isMirror(root, root);
    }

    private boolean isMirror(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2) {
        if(t1 == null && t2 == null) {
            return true;
        }
        if(t1 == null || t2 == null) {
            return false;
        }

        return (t1.val == t2.val) && isMirror(t1.left, t2.right) && isMirror(t1.right, t2.left);
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
* Time complexity: `O(n)`. Because we traverse the entire input tree once, the total run time is `O(n)`, where n is the total number of nodes in the tree.
* Space complexity: The number of recursive calls is bound by the height of the tree. In the worst case, the tree is linear and the height is in `O(n)`. Therefore, space complexity due to recursive calls on the stack is `O(n)` in the worst case.
