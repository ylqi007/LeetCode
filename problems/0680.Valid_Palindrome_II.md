## Method 1. Two Pointers
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean validPalindrome(String s) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = s.length() - 1;
        
        while(i < j) {
            // Found a mismatched pair and try both deletions
            if(s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(j)) {
                return (isPalindrome(s, i, j-1) || isPalindrome(s, i+1, j));
            }
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return true;
    }

    private boolean isPalindrome(String s, int i, int j) {
        while(i < j) {
            if(s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(j)) {
                return false;
            }
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
Given `N` as the length of s,
1. Time complexity: `O(N)`.
    * The main while loop we use can iterate up to `N / 2` times, since each iteration represents a pair of characters. On any given iteration, we may find a mismatch and call checkPalindrome twice. checkPalindrome can also iterate up to `N / 2` times, in the worst case where the first and last character of s do not match.
    * Because we are only allowed up to one deletion, the algorithm only considers one mismatch. This means that checkPalindrome will never be called more than twice.
    * As such, we have a time complexity of `O(N)`.
2. Space complexity: `O(1)`.
    * The only extra space used is by the two pointers `i` and `j`, which can be considered constant relative to the input size.
