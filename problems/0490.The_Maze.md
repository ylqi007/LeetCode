## Method 1. DFS (1ms, beats 100%)
```java
class Solution {
    private static final int[][] DIRS = {{-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}};

    public boolean hasPath(int[][] maze, int[] start, int[] destination) {
        int M = maze.length;
        int N = maze[0].length;
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[M][N];
        return dfs(maze, M, N, start, destination, visited);
    }

    private boolean dfs(int[][] maze, int M, int N, int[] curr, int[] destination, boolean[][] visited) {
        if(visited[curr[0]][curr[1]]) {
            return false;
        }
        if(curr[0] == destination[0] && curr[1] == destination[1]) {
            return true;
        }

        visited[curr[0]][curr[1]] = true;
        for(int[] dir: DIRS) {
            int r = curr[0] + dir[0];
            int c = curr[1] + dir[1];
            // Move the ball in the chosen direction until it can.
            while(r >= 0 && r < M && c >= 0 && c < N && maze[r][c] == 0) {
                r += dir[0];
                c += dir[1]; 
            }
            // Revert the last move to get the cell to which the ball rolls.
            if(dfs(maze, M, N, new int[]{r-dir[0], c-dir[1]}, destination, visited)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
Here, `m` and `n` are the number of rows and columns in maze.
1. Time complexity: `O(m⋅n⋅(m+n))`
   * Initializing the visit array takes `O(m⋅n)` time.
   * The function dfs visits each node at most once, resulting in `O(m⋅n)` calls. For each call, we loop through the node's neighbors. To discover neighboring nodes for a node, we check in each direction with a while loop and it would take `O(m)` steps for vertical directions or `O(n)` steps for horizontal directions to reach a wall, resulting in `O(m+n)` operations. It would take `O(m⋅n⋅(m+n))` in total for all the nodes.
2. Space complexity: `O(m⋅n)`
   * The visit array takes `O(m⋅n)` space.
   * The recursion stack used by dfs can have no more than `O(m⋅n)` elements in the worst-case scenario. It would take up `O(m⋅n)` space in that case.



## Method 2. BFS (7ms, beats 31%)
Only put positions which can be reached into the queue.
```java
class Solution {
    private static final int[][] DIRS = {{-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}};

    public boolean hasPath(int[][] maze, int[] start, int[] destination) {
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[maze.length][maze[0].length];
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(start);
        visited[start[0]][start[1]] = true;

        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] curr = queue.poll();
            if(curr[0] == destination[0] && curr[1] == destination[1]) {
                return true;
            }
            for(int[] dir: DIRS) {
                int x = curr[0] + dir[0];
                int y = curr[1] + dir[1];
                // Move the ball in the chosen direction until it can.
                while(x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x < maze.length && y < maze[0].length && maze[x][y] == 0) {
                    x += dir[0];
                    y += dir[1];
                }   // after while-loop, {x, y} is wall
                // Revert the last move to get the cell to which the ball rolls.
                if(!visited[x-dir[0]][y-dir[1]]) {
                    queue.add(new int[]{x-dir[0], y-dir[1]});
                    visited[x-dir[0]][y-dir[1]] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
Here, `m` and `n` are the number of rows and columns in maze.
1. Time complexity: `O(m⋅n⋅(m+n))`
    * Initializing the visit array takes `O(m⋅n)` time.
    * Each queue operation in the BFS algorithm takes `O(1)` time, and a single node can be pushed once, leading to `O(m⋅n)` operations for `m⋅n` nodes. We iterate over all the neighbors of each node that is popped out of the queue. To discover neighboring nodes for a node, we check in each direction with a while loop and it would take `O(m)` steps for vertical directions or `O(n)` steps for horizontal directions to reach a wall, resulting in `O(m+n)` operations. It would take `O(m⋅n⋅(m+n))` in total for all the nodes.
2. Space complexity: `O(m⋅n)`
   * The visit array takes `O(m⋅n)` space.
   * The BFS queue takes `O(m⋅n)` space in the worst-case because each node is added once.
