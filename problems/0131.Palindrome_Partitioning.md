Intuition:
1. The aim to partition the string into all possible palindrome combination. To achieve this,
we must generate all possible substring of a string by partitioning at every index until we
reach the end of the string.
2. Each generated substring is considered as a potentional candidate if it is a Palindrome.
3. In **Depth First Search**, we recursively expand potential candidate until the defined goal is 
achieved. After that, we backtrack to explore the next potential candidate.
4. **Backtracking** incrementally build the candidates for the solution and 
discard the candidates(i.e. backtrack) if it doesn't satisfy the condition.

The backtracking algorithm consists of the following steps:
1. **Choose:** Choose the potential candidate. Here, our potential candidates are all substrings
that could be generated from the given string.
2. **Constraint:** Define a constraint that must be satisfied by the chosen candidate. 
In this case, the constraint is that the string must be a palindrome.
3. **Goal:** We must define the goal that determines if we have found the required solution and 
we must backtrack. Here, our goal is achieved if we have reached the end of the string.


## ✅⭐Method 1. Backtracking + Recursion (6ms, beats 99%)
```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> partition(String s) {
        List<List<String>> res = new ArrayList<List<String>>();
        backtrack(res, new ArrayList<String>(), s.toCharArray(), 0);
        return res;
    }
    
    private void backtrack(List<List<String>> res, List<String> tmp, char[] ss, int start) {
        if(start == ss.length) {
            res.add(new ArrayList<String>(tmp));
        }
        for(int i=start; i<ss.length; i++) {
            if(isPalindrome(ss, start, i)) {
                tmp.add(new String(new String(ss, start, i-start+1)));
                backtrack(res, tmp, ss, i+1);
                tmp.remove(tmp.size() - 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    private boolean isPalindrome(char[] ss, int lo, int hi) {
        while(lo < hi) {
            if(ss[lo++] != ss[hi--]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
* Time Complexity: `O(N⋅2^N)`, where `N` is the length of string s. This is the worst-case time complexity when all the possible substrings are palindrome.
* Space Complexity: `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of the string s. This space will be used to store the recursion stack. For `s = "aaa"`, the maximum depth of the recursive call stack is 3 which is equivalent to `N`.


## Method 2. Backtracking with Dynamic Programming
Key Points:
1. This approach uses a similar Backtracking as method 1. The previous approach performs
one extra iteration to determine if a given substring is a palindrome or not.
2. There are Overlapping Subproblems and we could further optimize the approach by using
dynamic programming to determine if a string is a palindrome in constant time.

Algorithm: A given string `s` starting at index `start` and ending at index `end` is a 
palindrome if following conditions are satisfied:
1. The characters at start and end indexes are equal.
2. The substring starting at index `start+1` and ending at `end-` is a palindrome.
```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> partition(String s) {
        int N = s.length();
        boolean[][] dp = new boolean[N][N];
        List<List<String>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        dfs(s, 0, new ArrayList<>(), res, dp);
        return res;
    }
    
    private void dfs(String s, int start, List<String> tmp, List<List<String>> res, boolean[][] dp) {
        if(start >= s.length()) {
            res.add(new ArrayList<String>(tmp));
        }
        for(int end=start; end<s.length(); end++) {
            if(s.charAt(start) == s.charAt(end) && (end-start<=2 || dp[start+1][end-1])) {
                dp[start][end] = true;
                tmp.add(s.substring(start, end+1));
                dfs(s, end+1, tmp, res, dp);
                tmp.remove(tmp.size() - 1);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Complexity:
1. Time Complexity: `O(N⋅2^N)`, where `N` is the length of string s. 
In the worst case, there could be `2^N` possible substrings and it will take `O(N)` to generate each substring 
using substr as in Approach 1. However, we are eliminating one additional iteration to check if substring is a palindrome or not.
2. Space Complexity: `O(N⋅N)`, where `N` is the length of the string `s`. The recursive call stack would require `N` space as in Approach 1. 
Additionally we also use 2 dimensional array `dp` of size `N⋅N`.
