## Method 1. Depth-First Search, Recursion
> If you simply consider the depth first traversal on a tree, all it does is traverse once branch after another.
> All we need to do here is to simply execute the depth first traversal and maintain two things along the way:
> 1. A running sum of all the nodes traversed till that point in recursion and
> 2. A list of all those nodes. 
```java 
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> pathSum(TreeNode root, int sum) {
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<List<Integer>>();
        List<Integer> path = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        recurseTree(root, sum, path, res);
        return res;
    }
    
    private void recurseTree(TreeNode node, int sum, List<Integer> path, List<List<Integer>> res) {
        if(node == null) {
            return;
        }
        
        // Add the current node to the path
        path.add(node.val);
        
        // Check is the current node is a leaf and if the val of current node equals the remaining sum.
        // If it does, then we add the path to the res
        if(sum == node.val && node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            res.add(new ArrayList<>(path));
        } else {
            // Else, we will recurse on the left and the right children
            recurseTree(node.left, sum - node.val, path, res);
            recurseTree(node.right, sum - node.val, path, res);
        }
        // We need to pop the node once we done processing all of its subtrees.
        path.remove(path.size() - 1);
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
1. Time Complexity: `O(N^2)` where `N` is the number of nodes in a tree. In the worst case, we could have a complete binary tree and if that is the case, then there would be `N/2` leafs.
2. Space Complexity: `O(N)`. The space complexity, like many other problems is debatable here. 

> Why Breadth First Search is bad for this problem?
> We did touch briefly on this in the intuition section. BFS would solve this problem perfectly. However, note that the problem statement actually asks us to return a list of all the paths that add up to a particular sum. Breadth first search moves one level at a time. That means, we would have to maintain the pathNodes lists for all the paths till a particular level/depth at the same time.
> 
> Say we are at the level 10 in the tree and that level has e.g. 20 nodes. BFS uses a queue for processing the nodes. Along with 20 nodes in the queue, we would also need to maintain 20 different pathNodes lists since there is no backtracking here. That is too much of a space overhead.
> 
> The good thing about depth first search is that it uses recursion for processing one branch at a time and once we are done processing the nodes of a particular branch, we pop them from the pathNodes list thus saving on space. At a time, this list would only contain all the nodes in a single branch of the tree and nothing more. Had the problem statement asked us the total number of paths that add up to a particular sum (root to leaf), then breadth first search would be an equally viable approach.
