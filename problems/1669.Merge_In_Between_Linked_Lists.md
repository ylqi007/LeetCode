## Method 1
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeInBetween(ListNode list1, int a, int b, ListNode list2) {
        ListNode preA = list1;  // this need to point to `13` in example 1
        ListNode preB = list1;  // this need to point to `9` in example 1
        while(--a > 0 && --b > 0) {
            preA = preA.next;
        }
        preB = preA;
        while(b >= 0) {
            preB = preB.next;
            b--;
        }

        preA.next = list2;
        while(list2.next != null) {
            list2 = list2.next;
        }
        list2.next = preB;
        return list1;
