## DFS (recursive, My implementation, 1ms, beats 54%)
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    private int res;
    
    public int rangeSumBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        res = 0;
        dfs(root, low, high);
        return res;
    }

    private void dfs(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        if(root == null) {
            return;
        }

        dfs(root.left, low, high);
        if(root.val >= low && root.val <= high) {
            res += root.val;
        }
        dfs(root.right, low, high);        
    }
}
```

or 

```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}

 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

class Solution {
    private int res;
    
    public int rangeSumBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        res = 0;
        dfs(root, low, high);
        return res;
    }

    private void dfs(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        if(root == null) {
            return;
        }

        if(low <= root.val && root.val <= high) {
            res += root.val;
        }   
        if(root.val > low) {
            dfs(root.left, low, high);
        }
        if(root.val < high) {
            dfs(root.right, low, high);
        }
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
1. Time Complexity: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree.
2. Space Complexity: `O(N)`.
    * For the recursive and iterative implementations, we are performing a DFS (Depth-First Search) traversal. The recursive solution requires additional space to maintain the function call stack while the iterative solution requires additional space to maintain the stack. In both implementations, the worst-case scenario occurs when the tree is of chain shape, and we will reach all the way down to the leaf node. In this case, the space required for the stack is `O(N)`.


## Method 2. DFS (iterative, 4ms, beats 8%)
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

        Deque<TreeNode> stack = new LinkedList<>();
        stack.addLast(root);
        
        while(!stack.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode curr = stack.pop();
            if(curr != null) {
                if(low <= curr.val && curr.val <= high) {
                    res += curr.val;
                }
                if(low < curr.val) {
                    stack.push(curr.left);
                }
                if(curr.val < high) {
                    stack.push(curr.right);
                }
