## Method 1. (3ms, beat 99%)
Analysis:
1. The goal is to find if a player has won by marking an entire row, column, diagonal, or anti diagonal cells. 
2. Can we find this in constant time without iterating over each of the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal rows on every move? Yes!

Break the problem into two parts:
1. First, on every move, we must determine whether a player has marked all of the cells in a row or column. In other words, we could say that, if there are n rows and n columns on a board, the player must have marked a certain row or column n times.
2. Second, on every move, we must determine whether a player has marked all of the cells on the main diagonal or anti-diagonal. Irrespective of the size of the board, there can only be one diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

The meaning of `rows[i]` and `cols[i]`
1. `rows[i]` stores the number of times a player has marked a cell on the ith row.
2. `cols[i]` stores the number of times a player has marked a cell on the ith col

Winning Condition:
1. The player will win if either rows[i] or cols[j] is equal to n after the player has marked the cell on the ithi^{th}ith row and jthj^{th}jth column.
2. After a player has marked a cell on a diagonal row, we check if the value of variable diagonal for that player is equal to n. Similarly, after a player has marked a cell on an anti-diagonal row, we check if the value of variable antiDiagonal for that player is equal to n.
```java
class TicTacToe {
    private int[] rows;
    private int[] cols;
    private int diagonal;
    private int antiDiagonal;

    // rows[i] stores the number of times a player has marked a cell on the ith row.
    // cols[i] stores the number of times a player has marked a cell on the ith col
    public TicTacToe(int n) {
        rows = new int[n];
        cols = new int[n];
    }
    
    public int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        int currentPlayer = (player == 1) ? 1 : -1;
        // Update currentPlayer in rows and cols arrays
        rows[row] += currentPlayer;
        cols[col] += currentPlayer;

        // Update diagonal
        if(row == col) {
            diagonal += currentPlayer;
        }
        // Update antiDiagonal
        if(col == (cols.length - row - 1)) {
            antiDiagonal += currentPlayer;
        }

        int n = rows.length;
        // Check if the current player wins
        
        if(Math.abs(rows[row]) == n || Math.abs(cols[col]) == n || Math.abs(diagonal) == n || Math.abs(antiDiagonal) == n) {
            return player;
        }
        // No wins
        return 0;
    }
}

```
