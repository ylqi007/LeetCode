[191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/description/)


## Method 1. My Implementation
```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        while(n != 0) {
            res += (n & 1);
            n = n >>> 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```


## Method 2. 
```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        int mask = 1;
        for(int i=0; i<32; i++) {
            if((n & mask) != 0) {
                res++;
            }
            mask <<= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
* The run time depends on the number of bits in n. Because n in this piece of code is a 32-bit integer, the time complexity is O(1).
* The space complexity is O(1), since no additional space is allocated.
