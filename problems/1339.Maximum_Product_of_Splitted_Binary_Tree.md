## ðŸŸ© Method 1. One-Pass DFS (12ms, beats 27%)
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProduct(TreeNode root) {
        List<Integer> allSums = new ArrayList<>();

        long totalSum = treeSum(root, allSums);
        long result = 0;
        for(long sum: allSums) {
            result = Math.max(result, sum * (totalSum - sum));
        }

        return (int)(result % 1000000007);
    }

    private int treeSum(TreeNode subroot, List<Integer> sums) {
        if(subroot == null) {
            return 0;   // No subtree
        }

        int leftSum = treeSum(subroot.left, sums);
        int rightSum = treeSum(subroot.right, sums);
        int totalSum = leftSum + rightSum + subroot.val;
        sums.add(totalSum); // totalSum is sum of all nodes rooted at the current node
        return totalSum;
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:** `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
* Time Complexity: `O(n)`.
    * The recursive function visits each of the `n` nodes in the tree exactly once, performing an `O(1)` recursive operation on each. This gives a total of `O(n)`
    * There are `nâˆ’1` numbers in the list. Each of these is processed with an `O(1)` operation, giving a total of `O(n)` time for this phase too.
    * In total, we have `O(n)`.
* Space Complexity `O(n)`.
    * There are two places that extra space is used.
    * Firstly, the recursion is putting frames on the stack. The maximum number of frames at any one time is the maximum depth of the tree. For a balanced tree, this is around `O(logn)`, and in the worst case (a long skinny tree) it is `O(n)`.
    * Secondly, the list takes up space. It contains `nâˆ’1` numbers at the end, so it too is `O(n)`.
    * In both the average case and worst case, we have a total of `O(n)` space used by this approach.


## Method 2. Two-Pass DFS (6ms, beats 81%)
```java
class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = (int)Math.pow(10, 9) + 7;

    private long res = 0;
    private long totalSum = 0;
    
    public int maxProduct(TreeNode root) {
        totalSum = dfs(root);   // the 1st pass is to get the totalSum
        dfs(root);
        return (int)(res % MOD);
    }

    private int dfs(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        int sum = dfs(root.left) + root.val + dfs(root.right);
        res = Math.max(res, (totalSum - sum) * sum);
        return sum;
    }
}
```
Compared with Method 1, this method calls `dfs(root)` twice since it needs to calculate the `totalSum` first.
