## Method 1. Two Pointers

> The area formed between the lines will always be limited by the height of the shorter line.
>
> Further, the farther the lines, the more will be the area obtained.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = height.length - 1;
        int res = 0;
        while(i < j) {
            if(height[i] < height[j]) {
                res = Math.max(res, height[i] * (j - i));
                i++;
            } else {
                res = Math.max(res, height[j] * (j - i));
                j--;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis:**

- Time complexity : `O(n)`. Single pass.
- Space complexity : `O(1)`. Constant space is used.
