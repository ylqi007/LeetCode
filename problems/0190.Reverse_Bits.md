[190. Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/description/)


## Method 1.
> The key idea is that for a bit that is situated at the index `i`, after reversion, its position should be `31-i` (note: the index starts from zero)

* We iterate through the bit string of the input integer, from right to left, (i.e. `n = >>> 1`). To retrieve the right-most bit of an integer, we apply the bit AND operation (`n & 1`).
* For each bit, we reverse it to the correct position (i.e. `(n & 1) << power`). The we accumulate this reversed bit to the final result.
* When there is no more bits of one left (i.e. `n == 0`), we terminate the iteration.

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        int power = 31;
        while(n != 0) {
            res += (n & 1) << power;
            n = n >>> 1;    // logical shift right
            power--;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
**Complexity:**
* Time Complexity: `O(1)`. Though we have a loop in the algorithm, the number of iteration is fixed regardless the input, since the integer is of fixed-size (32-bits) in our problem.
* Space Complexity: `O(1)`, since the consumption of memory is constant regardless the input.
