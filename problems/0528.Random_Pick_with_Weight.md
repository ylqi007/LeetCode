## Method 1.
```java 
class Solution {

    private int[] prefixSums;
    private int totalSum;
    
    public Solution(int[] w) {
        prefixSums = new int[w.length];
        int prefixSum = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<w.length; i++) {
            prefixSum += w[i];
            prefixSums[i] = prefixSum;
        }
        totalSum = prefixSum;
    }
    
    public int pickIndex() {
        double target = this.totalSum * Math.random();
        int i = 0;
        // Run a linear search to find the target zone
        for(; i<this.prefixSums.length; i++) {
            if(target < prefixSums[i]) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        // to have a return statement, though this should never happen.
        return i - 1;
    }
}

 * int param_1 = obj.pickIndex();
 */
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
Let `N` be the length of the input list.
1. Time Complexity
    * For the `constructor` function, the time complexity would be `O(N)`, which is due to the construction of the prefix sums.
    * For the `pickIndex()` function, its time complexity would be `O(N)` as well, since we did a linear search on the prefix sums.
2. Space Complexity
    * For the `constructor` function, the space complexity would be `O(N)`, which is again due to the construction of the prefix sums.
    * For the `pickIndex()` function, its space complexity would be `O(1)`, since it uses constant memory. Note, here we consider the prefix sums that it operates on, as the input of the function.


## Method 2. Prefix Sums with Binary Search
```java 
class Solution {

    private int[] prefixSums;
    private int totalSum;
    
    public Solution(int[] w) {
        prefixSums = new int[w.length];
        int prefixSum = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<w.length; i++) {
            prefixSum += w[i];
            prefixSums[i] = prefixSum;
        }
        totalSum = prefixSum;
    }
    
    public int pickIndex() {
        double target = totalSum * Math.random();
        
        // Run a binary search to find the target zone
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = prefixSums.length;
        while(lo < hi) {        // [lo, hi), when lo >= hi, out of loop
            // better to avoid the over flow
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if(target > prefixSums[mid]) {  // If target > prefixSums[mid], then mid is not the value that we want,
                lo = mid + 1;               // so we need set lo = mid + 1
            } else {        // target<=prefixSums[mid], mid may be the value we want, so we need set hi = mid
                hi = mid;
            }
        }
        return lo;
    }
}

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution obj = new Solution(w);
 * int param_1 = obj.pickIndex();
 */
```

```Java
nums = [1, 3]
sums = [1, 4], ==> target = 4 * Math.random() belongs to [0, 4), suppose 2.3
lo=0, hi=1; ==> mid=0, target=2.3 > sums[0]=1 ==> lo=mid+1=0+1=1
```

**Complexity Analysis:**
Let `N` be the length of the input list.
1. Time Complexity
    * For the `constructor` function, the time complexity would be `O(N)`, which is due to the construction of the prefix sums.
    * For the `pickIndex()` function, this time its time complexity would be `O(log‚Å°N)`, since we did a binary search on the prefix sums.
2. Space Complexity
    * For the `constructor` function, the space complexity remains `O(N)`, which is again due to the construction of the prefix sums.
    * For the `pickIndex()` function, its space complexity would be `O(1)`, since it uses constant memory. Note, here we consider the prefix sums that it operates on, as the input of the function.
