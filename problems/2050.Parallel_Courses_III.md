[2050. Parallel Courses III](https://leetcode.com/problems/parallel-courses-iii/description/)


### Problem Summary
You're given:
* `n` courses labeled from `1` to `n`.
* A list of prerequisites: `relations[i] = [prevCourse, nextCourse]` means `prevCourse` must be completed before `nextCourse`.
* `time[i]` is the duration to complete the `i+1`-th course.

You can take **multiple courses in parallel** as long as all their prerequisites are complete.

ðŸ‘‰ **Goal**: Return the **minimum time** required to **complete all courses**.


### âœ… Approach: **Topological Sort + DP**

We model this as a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** and perform **topological sort**. We use **dynamic programming** to store the **earliest completion time** for each course.

### ðŸ”§ Key Steps:
1. **Build Graph:**
    * Use `adjacency list` to represent course dependencies.
    * Maintain `indegree[]` to track prerequisites for each course.
2. **Topological Sort (BFS):**
    * Use a queue to process courses with `indegree == 0` (no prerequisites).
    * For each course:
        * Update the completion time for its dependent courses.
3. **DP State:**
    * `dp[i]` = earliest time to finish course `i`.

### âœ… Java Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumTime(int n, int[][] relations, int[] time) {
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        int[] indegree = new int[n];
        int[] dp = new int[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
            dp[i] = time[i]; // init each course time
        }

        for (int[] rel : relations) {
            int u = rel[0] - 1;
            int v = rel[1] - 1;
            graph.get(u).add(v);
            indegree[v]++;
        }

        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) {
                queue.offer(i);
            }
        }

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int u = queue.poll();
            for (int v : graph.get(u)) {
                dp[v] = Math.max(dp[v], dp[u] + time[v]);
                if (--indegree[v] == 0) {
                    queue.offer(v);
                }
            }
        }

        int max = 0;
        for (int t : dp) {
            max = Math.max(max, t);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

### ðŸ§® Complexity

| Type  | Value                                                       |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time  | `O(n + e)` â€” n = number of courses, e = number of relations |
| Space | `O(n + e)` â€” adjacency list + dp + indegree                 |

---

### ðŸ§  Intuition

* Courses with no prerequisites can start immediately.
* A course with prerequisites must **wait until all its prerequisites are done**, so its start time = `max(dp[prereq])`.
* We accumulate the longest time path (critical path) across the DAG.
