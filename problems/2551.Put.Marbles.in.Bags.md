* Array, PriorityQueue(Heap), Sorting, Greedy
* Amazon, Uber, Flipkart


## Method 1. Sorting + Greedy
Since the score of a subarray only matters with its two ends, we can tell that the total score equals the sum of the first element, the last element, and the sum of every pair (two adjacent ends at each split).

In general, if we partition the array into k groups, we always make k - 1 splitting points regardless of how the array is partitioned.


* `MinScore=weights[0] + weights[n-1] + pairWeights[0] + ... + pairWeights[k-2]` (weights of 2 ends + weights of k-1 pairs)
* `MaxScore=weights[0] + weights[n-1] + pairWeights[?] + ... + pairWeights[n-2]` (weights of 2 ends + weights of k-1 pairs)
    * What's the value of `?`? `n-2 - ? + 1 = k-1` ==> `? = n-k`

`MaxScore=weights[0]+weights[n−1]+pairWeights[]
​
 pairWeights[i] (if sorted the array pairWeights in non-decreasing order)

```Java
class Solution {
    public long putMarbles(int[] weights, int k) {
        // Collect and sort the value of all n-1 pairs
        int n = weights.length;
        int[] pairWeights = new int[n-1];   // Index range is from 0 to n-2
        for(int i=0; i<n-1; i++) {
            pairWeights[i] = weights[i] + weights[i+1];
        }

        // There are n-2 elements in the array, sort them.
        Arrays.sort(pairWeights);

        // Get the difference between the largest (k-1) values and the smallest (k-1) values.
        long res = 0L;
        for(int i=0; i<k-1; i++) {
            res += pairWeights[n-2-i] - pairWeights[i];
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
1. Time: `O(n⋅log⁡n)`. We need to sort the pairWeights, the array of every pair value having `n - 1` elements, it takes `O(n⋅log⁡n)` time. We then traverse the sorted pairWeights and calculate the cumulative sum of the `k - 1` largest elements and the sum of the `k - 1` smallest elements, this step takes `O(k)` time. To sum up, the overall time complexity is `O(n⋅log⁡n)`.
2. Space complexity: `O(n)`. We create an auxiliary array pairWeights of size `n - 1` to store the value of all pairs.
