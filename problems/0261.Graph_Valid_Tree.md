也就是判断是否有环存在，若有环则说明不是一棵树。


## Method 1. Union Find
* If there is a cycle, then it isn't a valid tree;
* After adding all edges, if there have more than one roots, then it isn't a valid tree.

* 如果整棵树只有一个 root，则说明是一颗说；如果 root 的个数大于 1 个，则说明不是一颗 valid tree。

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean validTree(int n, int[][] edges) {
        // Initialize the root forest
        int[] roots = new int[n];
        int[] rank = new int[n];
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            roots[i] = i;
        }
        
        
        for(int[] edge: edges) {
            int root1 = find(roots, edge[0]);
            int root2 = find(roots, edge[1]);
            if(root1 == root2) {    // edge[0] and edge[1] have the same root, then add this edge will introduce a cycle
                return false;
            }
            if(rank[root1] < rank[root2]) {
                roots[root1] = root2;
            } else if(rank[root1] > rank[root2]) {
                roots[root2] = root1;
            } else {
                roots[root1] = root2;
                rank[root2]++;
            }
            n--;
        }
        return n == 1;  // Make sure just one root
    }
    
    private int find(int[] roots, int id) {
        if(id != roots[id]) {
            roots[id] = find(roots, roots[id]);
        }
        return roots[id];
    }

    // private int find(int[] root, int id) {   // path compression
    //     int i = id;
    //     while(root[i] != i) {
    //         i = root[i];
    //     }
    //     root[id] = i;
    //     return root[id];
    // }
}
```
**Complexity:**
* Time Complexity : O(N⋅α(N)).
* Space Complexity : O(N).


## ✅ Method 1. UnionFind from ChatGPT (beats 100.00%)
We first check the necessary condition for a tree (edges.length == n-1), then we union each edge—if any union finds its two endpoints already connected, we’ve detected a cycle and return false. 
If we finish without cycles, the “exactly n−1 edges” check guarantees connectivity, so we return true.
```java
/**
1. A tree with n nodes has exactly n−1 edges
2. A tree has no cycle.
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean validTree(int n, int[][] edges) {
        // A tree with nodes must have n-1 edges
        if(edges.length != n - 1) {
            return false;
        }
        
        UnionFind uf = new UnionFind(n);
        for(int[] e: edges) {
            // If u and v were already connected, we found a cycle
            if(!uf.union(e[0], e[1])) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    private static class UnionFind {
        private final int[] parent;
        private final int[] rank;

        UnionFind(int n) {
            parent = new int[n];
            rank = new int[n];
            for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
                parent[i] = i;
                rank[i] = 1;
            }
        }

        // Find with path-compression
        int find(int x) {
            if(parent[x] != x) {
                parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
            }
            return parent[x];
        }
        
        // Union by rank
        // Return false if x and y were already connected, i.e. in the same set (cycle)
        boolean union(int x, int y) {
            int px = find(x);
            int py = find(y);
            if(px == py) {
                return false;   // cycle detected
            }
            
            // Attach smaller rank tree under larger rank
            if(rank[px] < rank[py]) {
                parent[px] = py;
            } else if(rank[py] < rank[px]) {
                parent[py] = px;
            } else {
                parent[py] = px;
                rank[px]++;
            }
            return true;
        }

    }
}
```
**Why this works**
1. Edge count check: A tree with n nodes must have exactly n − 1 edges.
2. Union-Find:
   * find(x) returns the representative of x’s set.
   * union(x,y) merges their sets if they’re different, or returns false if they’re already the same (which detects a cycle).
3. Connectivity: If there are no cycles and we have exactly n − 1 edges, the graph must be connected (a well-known fact), so it’s a tree.

**Complexity**
* Time: 
  * Edge count check: O(1)
  * Union-Find over E edges and V nodes: near-O(E · α(V)) ≈ O(E)
* Space: O(n) for the parent and rank arrays.


## Method 2. Graph Theory + Iterative Depth-First Search
> For the graph to be a valid tree, it must have *exactly* `n-1` edges.
> Any less, and it can't possibly be fully connected.
> Any more, and it has to contain a cycle.
> Additionally, if the graph is fully connected and contains *exactly* `n-1` edges, it can't possibly contain a cycle, and therefore must be a tree!

Recall that a graph, `G`, **is a tree iff** the following two conditions are met:
1. `G` is a fully connected. In other words, for every pair of nodes in `G`, there is a path between them;
2. `G` contains no cycles. In other words, there is exactly *one* path between each pair of nodes in `G`.

**Depth-First Search** is a classic graph-traversal algorithm that can be used to check for both of these conditions:
1. `G` is fully connected if, and only if, we started a depth-first search from a single source and discovered *all* nodes in `G` during it.
2. `G` contains no cycles if, and only if, the depth-first search never goes back to an already discovered node.
We need to be careful though not to count trivial cycles of the form `A -> B -> A` that occur with most implementations of undirected edges.

There are graph representations:
1. An **adjacency list**. An **adjacency list** is where we have a list of sub-lists, where each sub-list is the list of the immediate neighbors of the i-th node.
2. An **adjacency matrix**. Often, we'd only use an adjacency matrix if we *know* that the number of edges is substantially higher thanthe number of nodes.
3. A **linked representation**, where you make actual nodes objects, would be an overly complicated representation and could suggest to an interviewer that you have a limited understanding of adjacency lists and adjacency matrices.

The first step is to convert the input into an **adjacency list**. 
1. **If the graph is fully connected,** then every node must have been seen. This means that all nodes must be in the `seen` set at the end.
```java 
# Return true if and only if the depth first search discovered all nodes.
return seen.size() == n;
```
2. 

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean validTree(int n, int[][] edges) {
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
        }
        for(int[] edge: edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            graph.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }
        
        Map<Integer, Integer> parent = new HashMap<>();
        parent.put(0, -1);      // curr node --> curr's parent
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
        stack.push(0);
        
        while(!stack.isEmpty()) {
            int node = stack.pop();
            for(int nei: graph.get(node)) {
                if(parent.get(node) == nei) {   // node is nei's parent
                    continue;
                }
                if(parent.containsKey(nei)) {   // the node `nei` has more than 1 parent --> not a tree
                    return false;
                }
                stack.push(nei);
                parent.put(nei, node);
            }
        }
        return parent.size() == n;      // each node has only one parent
    }
}
```
**Complexity:**
* Time complexity: O(N+E).
* Space Complexity : O(N+E).


## Method 3. DFS
1. 首先检查 graph 中是否存在 cycle，如果有 cycle，则说明肯定不是 valid tree；
2. 确保所有的 nodes 都连在一起。

```java 
class Solution {
    public boolean validTree(int n, int[][] edges) {
        // Initialize adjacent list
        List<List<Integer>> adjList = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Initialize
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            adjList.add(i, new ArrayList<Integer>());
        }
        for(int[] edge: edges) {
            adjList.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            adjList.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }
        
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        
        // Make sure there is no cycle. If there has cycle, then this is not a valid tree
        if(hasCycle(adjList, visited, 0, -1)) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Make sure all vertices are connected
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if(!visited[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    // Check if an undirected graph has cycle started from vertex u
    private boolean hasCycle(List<List<Integer>> adjList, boolean[] visited, int curr, int parent) {
        visited[curr] = true;
        
        // Case 1. node next is already visited, but it's not curr's parent ==> i.e. child node `next` is already visited before curr node
        // Case 2. node next is not visited but there is a cycle from node next
        for(int next: adjList.get(curr)) {
            if((visited[next] && parent!=next) || (!visited[next] && hasCycle(adjList, visited, next, curr))) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;   // No cycle
    }
}
```
