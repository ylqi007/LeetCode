## Method 1. Recursion/DFS

Key Points: 思路是**后序遍历**，因为路径和总是要包括左孩子val + 右孩子val + 当前节点val（注意不是根节点）

1. Implement a function `max_gain(node)` which takes a node as an argument and computes a 
   maximum contribution that this node and one/zero of its subtrees could add.  
   `max_gain(node)` 以 `node` 做为参数，返回包含该 `node` 以及该 `node` 的 0 个或 1 个子树的最大值。      
2. In other words, it's a *maximum gain* one could have including the node (and maybe one of its 
   subtree) into the path.

```java
class Solution {
    private int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        maxGain(root);
        return max;
    }
    
    private int maxGain(TreeNode node) {
        if(node == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Max sum on the left and right sub-tree of node
        int leftGain = Math.max(0, maxGain(node.left));
        int rightGain = Math.max(0, maxGain(node.right));
        
        // The price to start a new path where 'node' is a highest node
        int priceNewPath = node.val + leftGain + rightGain; // i.e. the subtree rooted at this node
        
        // Update the max sum of it's better to start a new path
        max = Math.max(max, priceNewPath);
        
        // For recursion: return the max gain if continue the same path
        return node.val + Math.max(leftGain, rightGain);
    }
}
```

or 
```java
class Solution {
    private int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;    // 注意初始值为 Integer.MIN_VALUE, 因为最终结果可能为负值
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        helper(root);
        return max;
    }
    
    private int helper(TreeNode node) {
        if(node == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        int l = Math.max(0, helper(node.left));
        int r = Math.max(0, helper(node.right));
        max = Math.max(max, l + node.val + r);
        return node.val + Math.max(l, r);
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**
1. Time complexity: `O(N)`, where `N` is number of nodes, since we visit each node not more than 2 times.
    * Each node in the tree is visited only once. 
    * During a visit, we perform constant time operations, including two recursive calls and calculating the max path sum for the current node. 
    * So the time complexity is `O(N)`.
2. Space complexity: `O(H)`, where `H` is a tree height, to keep the recursion stack. 
   * We don't use any auxiliary data structure, but the recursive call stack can go as deep as the tree's height. 
   * In the average case of balanced tree, the tree height `H=logN`.
   * In the worst case, the tree is a linked list, so the height is `N`. Therefore, the space complexity is `O(N)`.
