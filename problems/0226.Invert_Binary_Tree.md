[226. Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/description/)


## Method 1. Recursion (My Implementation)
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) {
            return root;
        }
        // This if-statement can be avoided
        if(root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            return root;
        }
        TreeNode left = invertTree(root.right);
        TreeNode right = invertTree(root.left);
        root.left = left;
        root.right = right;
        return root;
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
* Since each node in the tree is visited only once, the time complexity is `O(n)`, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
* Because of recursion, `O(h)` function calls will be placed on the stack in the worst case, where h is the height of the tree. Because `hâˆˆO(n)`, the space complexity is `O(n)`.


## Method 2. Iterative
