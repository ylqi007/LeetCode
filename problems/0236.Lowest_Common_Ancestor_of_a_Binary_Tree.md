**Notes:**
1. All `node.val` are unique.
2. `p != q`
3. `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.

## Method 1. Recursive
**Algorithm**
1. Start traversing the tree from the root node.
2. If the current node itself is one of `p` or `q`, we would mark a variable `mid` as True and continue the search for the other node in the left and right branches.
3. If either of the left or the right branch returns True, this means one of the two nodes was found below.
4. If at any point in the traversal, any two of the three flags left, right or mid become True, this means we have found the lowest common ancestor for the nodes p and q.

```java
class Solution {
    private TreeNode res;
    
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        recurseTree(root, p, q);
        return res;
    }
    
    private boolean recurseTree(TreeNode curr, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        // If reached the end of a branch, return false
        if(curr == null) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Left branch. If left recursion returns ture, set left=1 else 0
        int left = recurseTree(curr.left, p, q) ? 1 : 0;
        int right = recurseTree(curr.right, p, q) ? 1 : 0;
        
        // If the current node is one of p or q
        int mid = (curr == p || curr == q) ? 1 : 0;
        
        if(mid + left + right >= 2) {
            res = curr;
        }
        return mid + left + right > 0;  // > 0: means we find at least one node of p and q
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
1. Time Complexity: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. In the worst case we might be visiting all the nodes of the binary tree.
2. Space Complexity: `O(N)`. This is because the maximum amount of space utilized by the recursion stack would be NNN since the height of a skewed binary tree could be `N`.


## Method 2. Recursion
Key Points:
1. `left == null`, means that there is no `p` or `q` in the left subtree.
2. `right == null`, means that there is no `p` or `q` in the right subtree.

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(root==null || root==p || root==q) {
            return root;
        }
        
        TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        
        return (left == null) ? right : (right == null) ? left : root;
    }
}
```
