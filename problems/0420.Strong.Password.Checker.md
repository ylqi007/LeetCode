## Method 1. 
```Java
class Solution {
    public int strongPasswordChecker(String password) {
        int res = 0;
        int a = 1;  // The number of lower character that is missing from the strong password
        int A = 1;  // The number of upper character that is missing from the strong password
        int d = 1;  // The number of digit that is missing from the strong password
        char[] chars = password.toCharArray();
        int[] counts = new int[chars.length];

        for(int i=0; i<counts.length; ) {
            if(Character.isLowerCase(chars[i])) {
                a = 0;
            }
            if(Character.isUpperCase(chars[i])) {
                A = 0;
            }
            if(Character.isDigit(chars[i])) {
                d = 0;
            }
            int j=i;
            while(i < chars.length && chars[i] == chars[j]) {
                i++;
            }
            counts[j] = i - j;  // counts[j] represents the length of repeating sequence
        }
        int totalMissing = a + A + d;

        if(counts.length < 6) {
            res += totalMissing + Math.max(0, 6 - (chars.length + totalMissing));
        } else {
            int overLen = Math.max(chars.length-20, 0);
            res += overLen;

            int leftOver = 0;
            for(int k=1; k<3; k++) {
                for(int i=0; i<chars.length && overLen>0; i++) {
                    if(counts[i] < 3 || counts[i] % 3 != (k-1)) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    counts[i] -= Math.min(overLen, k);
                    overLen -= k;
                }
            }

            for(int i=0; i<counts.length; i++) {
                if(counts[i]>=3 && overLen>0) {
                    int need = counts[i] - 2;
                    counts[i] -= overLen;
                    overLen -= need;
                }
                if(counts[i] >= 3) {
                    leftOver += counts[i ] / 3;
                }
            }
            res += Math.max(totalMissing, leftOver);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

When the string length is greater than 20 characters, we can optimize the edits of triplets by considering three cases:
1. When the sequences of the same character are evenly divisible by 3. `length%3 == 0` should have higher priority
2. When they have one extra character. `length%3 == 1` second
3. and when they are one character off from being evenly divisible by 3. `length%3 == 2` lowest

For any repeating sequences with `length % 3 == 0`, we can reduce one replacement by deleting one character.
