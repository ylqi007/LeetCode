## Method 1. Two Pointers (My implementation on 2024/10/08)
```java
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        if(word1 == null || word1.length() == 0) {
            return word2;
        }
        if(word2 == null || word2.length() == 0) {
            return word1;
        }

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while(i<word1.length() && j<word2.length()) {
            sb.append(word1.charAt(i++));
            sb.append(word2.charAt(j++));
        }

        if(i == word1.length()) {
            while(j < word2.length()) {
                sb.append(word2.charAt(j++));
            }
        } 
        
        if(j == word2.length()) {
            while(i < word1.length()) {
                sb.append(word1.charAt(i++));
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis:** Here, `m` is the length of `word1` and `n` is the length of `word2`.
* Time complexity: `O(m+n)`
  * We iterate over `word1` and `word2` once and push their letters into result. It would take `O(m+n)` time.
* Space complexity: `O(1)`
  * Without considering the space consumed by the input strings (`word1` and `word2`) and the output string (result), we do not use more than constant space.


## Method 2: Two Pointers (LeetCode implementation) [更简洁]
```java
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        int m = word1.length();
        int n = word2.length();
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        while(i < m || j < n) {
            if(i < m) {
                sb.append(word1.charAt(i++));
            }
            if(j < n) {
                sb.append(word2.charAt(j++));
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
