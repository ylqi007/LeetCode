## Method 1. Stack
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] asteroidCollision(int[] asteroids) {
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        
        for(int asteroid: asteroids) {
            boolean flag = true;
            while(!stack.isEmpty() && (stack.peek() > 0 && asteroid < 0)) {
                // If the top asteroid in the stack is smaller, then it will explode.
                // Hence popit from the stack, also continue with the next ssteroid in the stack.
                if(Math.abs(stack.peek()) < Math.abs(asteroid)) {
                    stack.pop();
                    continue;
                } else if(Math.abs(stack.peek()) == Math.abs(asteroid)) {
                    // If both asteroids have the same size, then both asteroids will explorde.
                    // Pop the asteroid from the stack; also, we won't push the current asteroid to the stack
                    stack.pop();
                }
                // If we reach here, the current asteroid will be destryod.
                // Hence, we should not add it to the stack
                flag = false;
                break;
            }
            if(flag) {
                stack.push(asteroid);
            }
        }

        // Add the asteroids from the stack to the vector in the reverse order.
        int[] remainingAsteroids = new int[stack.size()];
        for(int i=remainingAsteroids.length-1; i>=0; i--) {
            remainingAsteroids[i] = stack.peek();
            stack.pop();
        }
        return remainingAsteroids;
    }

}
```

**Complexity Analysis:**
Here, N is the number of asteroids in the list.
1. Time complexity: `O(N)`. We iterate over each asteroid in the list, and for each asteroid, we might iterate over the asteroids we have in the stack and keep popping until they explode. The important point is that each asteroid can be added and removed from the stack only once. Therefore, each asteroid can be processed only twice, first when we iterate over it and then again while popping it from the stack. Therefore, the total time complexity is equal to `O(N)`.
2. Space complexity: `O(N)`. The only space required is for the stack; the maximum number of asteroids that could be there in the stack is `N` when there is no asteroid collision. The final list that we return, `remainingAsteroids`, is used to store the output, which is generally not considered part of space complexity. Hence, the total space complexity equals `O(N)`.


## Method 2. 
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] asteroidCollision(int[] asteroids) {
        if(asteroids==null || asteroids.length==0) {
            return new int[]{};
        }
        
        int[] stack = new int[asteroids.length+1];
        stack[0] = -1;
        int idx = 1;
        for(int n: asteroids) {
            while(stack[idx-1]>0 && n<0) {
                int sum = stack[idx-1] + n;
                if(sum > 0) {
                    n = stack[idx-1];
                } else if(sum == 0) {
                    n = 0;
                }
                idx--;
            }
            if(n != 0) {
                stack[idx++] = n;
            }
        }
        return Arrays.copyOfRange(stack, 1, idx);
    }
}
```
