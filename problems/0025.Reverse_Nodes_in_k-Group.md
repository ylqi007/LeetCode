The problem statement clearly mentions that we are not to use any additional space for solution. So naturally, a **recursive solution** is not acceptable here because of the space utilized by the recursion stack.

THe problem statement mentions that if there are `< k nodes` left in the linked list, then we don't have to reverse them. This implies that we first need to count `k` nodes before we get on with our traversal. If at any point, we find that we don't have `k` nodes, then we don't reverse that portion of the linked list.

## Method 1. Recursion
> The recursive approach is a natural fit for this problem since the problem asks us to perform a modification operation on a fixed portion of the linked list, one portion at a time.
> Since a sub-list of a linked list is a linked list itself, we can make use of recursion to do the heavy lifting for us. 
> All we need to focus here is how we are going to reverse those `k` nodes.
> 递归方法(recursive approach)是很直观能想到的方法. 我们首先在**固定长度的一部分**上做修改操作, 然后一部分一部分做修改.
> 由于sub-list本身也是linked list, 因此我们可以使用recursive approach来解决sub-list.
> 我们需要关注的就是这`k`个要 reverse 的 nodes.
>
> We also need to make sure we are hooking up the right connections as recursion backtracks.
> 比如对于 list `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`, 要求 reverse 相邻的 2 个 nodes. 
> 首先 reverse 前两个 nodes, 得到 `2, 1`, 然后通过 recursive function reverse 剩下的 sub-list, 得到 `4, 3, 5`.
> 然后我们需要保证我们能正确链接 `1 -> 4`, 以保证我们得到的 overall list 是正确的.

            ptr = nextNode;
            
            // Decrement the count of nodes to be reversed by 1
            k--;

Complexity Analysis
* Time Complexity: `O(N)` since we process each node exactly twice. Once when we are counting the
 number of nodes in each recursive call, and then once when we are actually reversing the sub-list. 
 A slightly optimized implementation here could be that we don't count the number of nodes at all
 and simply reverse k nodes. If at any point we find that we didn't have enough nodes, we can 
 re-reverse the last set of nodes so as to keep the original structure as required by the problem
 statement. That ways, we can get rid of the extra counting.   
* Space Complexity: `O(N/k)` used up by the recursion stack. The number of recursion calls is
 determined by both `k` and `N`. In every recursive call, we process `k` nodes and then make a
 recursive call to process the rest.   



## Method 2. Iterative `O(1)` space
> We can use a couple additional variables to maintain the proper connections along the way. We
> still count `k` nodes at a time. If we find `k` nodes, then we reverse them.

        while(count < k && curr != null) {
            curr = curr.next;
            count++;
        }   // After the while loop, either count == k or curr == null
        
        if(count == k) {
            curr = reverseKGroup(curr, k);  // curr is the head of the sublist
            // head: head-pointer of the original part
            // curr: head-pointer of the reversed part
            while(count-- > 0) {    // reverse k nodes
                ListNode tmp = head.next;   // Point to the next head in original part
                head.next = curr;       // preappend "original" head to the reversed list.
                curr = head;            // Move head of reversed part to a new node
                head = tmp;             // Move "original" head to the next node in original part.
            }
            head = curr;
        }
        return head;
