## Method 1. A Linked List Problem
```Java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
};
*/

class Solution {
    public Node lowestCommonAncestor(Node p, Node q) {
        List<Node> path = findPath(p);
        while(q.parent != null) {
            for(Node node: path) {
                if(node == q) {
                    return q;
                }
            }
            q = q.parent;
        }
        return q;
    }

    private List<Node> findPath(Node p) {
        List<Node> path = new ArrayList<>();
        while(p.parent != null) {
            path.add(p);
            p = p.parent;
        }
        return path;
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
1. Time complexity: `O(N+M)`.
    1. Firstly, we need to build up the hash table. It costs `O(1)` to insert an item into a hash table, and we need to do this for each of the `M` nodes in list B. This gives a cost of `O(M)` for building the hash table.
    2. Secondly, we need to traverse list A, and for each node, we need to check whether or not it is in the hash table. In the worst case, there will not be a match, requiring us to check all NNN nodes in list A. As it is also `O(1)` to check whether or not an item is in a hash table, this checking has a total cost of `O(N)`.
    3. Finally, combining the two parts, we get `O(M)+O(N)=O(M+N)`.
2. Space complexity: `O(M)`.

As we are storing each of the nodes from list B into a hash table, the hash table will require `O(M)` space. Note that we could have instead stored the nodes of list A into the hash table, this would have been a space complexity of `O(N)`. Unless we know which list is longer though, it doesn't make any real difference.


### 1.1 Version using `Set`
```Java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
};
*/

class Solution {
    public Node lowestCommonAncestor(Node p, Node q) {
        Set<Node> path = findPath(p);
        while(q.parent != null) {
            if(path.contains(q)) {
                return q;
            }
            q = q.parent;
        }
        return q;
    }

    private Set<Node> findPath(Node p) {
        Set<Node> res = new HashSet<>();
        while(p.parent != null) {
            res.add(p);
            p = p.parent;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```


## Method 2. Two Pointers
```Java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
};
*/

class Solution {
    public Node lowestCommonAncestor(Node p, Node q) {
        Node p1 = p;
        Node p2 = q;
        while(p1 != p2) {
            p1 = p1 == null ? q : p1.parent;
            p2 = p2 == null ? p : p2.parent;
        }
        return p1;
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
1. Time: `O(M+N)`
2. Space: `O(1)`

* According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a tree T is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."
