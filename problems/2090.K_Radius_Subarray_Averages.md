## Method 1. Prefix
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] getAverages(int[] nums, int k) {
        // When a single elements is considered, then its average will be the number itself
        if(k == 0) {
            return nums;
        }

        int windowSize = 2 * k + 1;
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] averages = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(averages, -1);

        // Any index will not have 'k' elements in its' left and right
        if(windowSize > n) {
            return averages;
        }

        // Generate prefix array for nums
        // prefix[i+1] will be the sum of all elements of nums from index 0 to i
        long[] prefix = new long[n+1];
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + nums[i];
        }

        // We iterate only on those indices which have at least k elements in their left and right
        for(int i=k; i<(n-k); i++) {
            int leftBound = i - k;
            int rightBound = i + k;
            long windowSum = prefix[rightBound + 1] - prefix[leftBound];
            averages[i] = (int)(windowSum / windowSize);
        }
        return averages;
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
Here, `n` is the number of elements in the nums array.
1. Time complexity: `O(n)`
    * We generate the prefix array by iterating on the nums array once, thus it will take `O(n)` time.
    * Then, we fill the averages array by again iterating on the nums array, where finding the average of each index is a constant time operation, thus, it will take us `O(n)` time.
    * So, overall we take `O(n)` time.
2. Space complexity: `O(n)`
    * The output array averages is not considered as additional space usage.
    * But, we have used another additional array prefix of size `n + 1`, thus, we use `O(n)` additional space in this approach.


## Method 2. Sliding Window
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] getAverages(int[] nums, int k) {
        if(k == 0) {
            return nums;
        }

        int windowSize = 2 * k + 1;
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] averages = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(averages, -1);

        // Any index will not have k elements to its left and right
        if(windowSize > n) {
            return averages;
        }

        // First get the sum of first window of the nums array
        long windowSum = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<windowSize; i++) {
            windowSum += nums[i];
        }
        averages[k] = (int)(windowSum / windowSize);

        // Iterate on rest indices which have at least k elements to its left and right
        for(int i=windowSize; i<n; i++) {
            windowSum = windowSum - nums[i-windowSize] + nums[i];
            averages[i-k] = (int)(windowSum / windowSize);
        }

        return averages;
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
Here, `n` is the number of elements in the nums array.
1. Time complexity: `O(n)`
    * Initializing the averages array with `-1` will take `O(n)` time.
    * Then we iterate over the nums array linearly to find the k-radius average of each index, which will also take `O(n)` time.
    * Thus, overall we use `O(n)` time.
2. Space complexity: `O(1)`
    * The output array averages is not considered as additional space usage.
