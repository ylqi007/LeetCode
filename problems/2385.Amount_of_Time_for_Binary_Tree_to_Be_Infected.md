## Method 1. Convert to Graph and Breadth-First Search (140ms)
1. Convert the binary tree to an undirected graph
2. Conduct a Breath First Search (BFS) to find the maximum distance between the start and other vertices.

```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

class Solution {
    public int amountOfTime(TreeNode root, int start) {
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        buildGraph(root, null, graph);

        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(start);
        int minute = 0;
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
        visited.add(start);

        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int levelSize = queue.size();
            while(levelSize > 0) {
                int curr = queue.poll();
                for(int num: graph.getOrDefault(curr, new ArrayList<>())) {
                    if(!visited.contains(num)) {
                        visited.add(num);
                        queue.add(num);
                    }
                }
                levelSize--;
            }
            minute++;
        }
        return minute-1;
    }

    private void buildGraph(TreeNode current, TreeNode parent, Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph) {
        if(current == null) return;

        if(current != null && parent != null) {
            graph.computeIfAbsent(current.val, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(parent.val);
            graph.computeIfAbsent(parent.val, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(current.val);
        }

        buildGraph(current.left, current, graph);
        buildGraph(current.right, current, graph);
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
Let `n` be the number of nodes in the tree.
1. Time complexity: `O(n)`
    * Converting the tree to a graph using a preorder traversal costs `O(n)`. We then perform BFS, which also costs `O(n)` because we don't visit a node more than once.
2. Space complexity: `O(n)`
    * When converting the tree to a graph, we require `O(n)` extra space for the map. We also require `O(n)` space for the queue and `O(n)` space for the visited set during the BFS.


## Method 2. One-Pass Depth-First Search (8ms)
**Algorithm:**
1. If the node with value `start` happened to be the `root`, the `maxDistance` from `start` would equivalent to the maximum depth of the tree. 
2. 

Is there a way to calculate the `maxDistance` from the `start` node using the subtree depths, even when the `start` node is not the `root`? This would help us solve the problem in just one pass. 



```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    private int maxDistance = 0;

    public int amountOfTime(TreeNode root, int start) {
        traverse(root, start);
        return maxDistance;
    }

    private int traverse(TreeNode root, int start) {
        int depth = 0;
        if(root == null) {
            return depth;
        }

        int leftDepth = traverse(root.left, start);
        int rightDepth = traverse(root.right, start);
        
        if(root.val == start) {
            maxDistance = Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth);
            depth = -1;
        } else if(leftDepth >= 0 && rightDepth >= 0) {
            depth = Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth) + 1;
        } else {
            int distance = Math.abs(leftDepth) + Math.abs(rightDepth);
            maxDistance = Math.max(maxDistance, distance);
            depth = Math.min(leftDepth, rightDepth) - 1;
        }
        return depth;
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
Let `n` be the number of nodes in the tree.
1. Time complexity: `O(n)`
    * Traversing the tree with a DFS costs `O(n)` as we visit each node exactly once.
2. Space complexity: `O(n)`
    * The space complexity of DFS is determined by the maximum depth of the call stack, which corresponds to the depth of the tree (or the graph in our case). In the worst case, if the tree is completely unbalanced (e.g., a linked list), the call stack can grow as deep as the number of nodes, resulting in a space complexity of `O(n)`.
