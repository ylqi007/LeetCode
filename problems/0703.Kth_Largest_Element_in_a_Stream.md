## Heap
```Java
class KthLargest {
    private static int k;
    private PriorityQueue<Integer> heap;    // small --> large

    public KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) {
        this.k = k;
        this.heap = new PriorityQueue<>();  // i.e. minHeap
        for(int num: nums) {
            heap.offer(num);
        }
        while(heap.size() > k) {
            heap.poll();
        }
    }
    
    public int add(int val) {
        heap.offer(val);
        if(heap.size() > k) {
            heap.poll();
        }
        return heap.peek();
    }
}

/**
 * Your KthLargest object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * KthLargest obj = new KthLargest(k, nums);
 * int param_1 = obj.add(val);
 */
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
Let `M` be the size of the initial stream nums given in the constructor, and let `N` be the number of calls to add.
* Time Complexity: `O((M+N)⋅logk)`
    * The add function involves adding and removing an element from a heap of size k, which is an O(logk) operation. Since the add function is called N times, the total time complexity for all add calls is O(N⋅logk).
    * The constructor also calls add M times to initialize the heap, leading to a time complexity of O(M⋅logk).
    * Therefore, the overall time complexity is O((M+N)⋅logk).
* Space Complexity: `O(k)`
    * The minHeap maintains at most k elements, so the space complexity is O(k).
