## Method 1. My Solution, Backtracking
```java
class Solution {
    private static final int[][] DIRS = {{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
    public boolean exist(char[][] board, String word) {
        char[] w = word.toCharArray();
        for(int i=0; i<board.length; i++) {
            for(int j=0; j<board[0].length; j++) {
                if(board[i][j] == w[0] && dfs(board, i, j, w, 0)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    private boolean dfs(char[][] board, int i, int j, char[] word, int idx) {
        if(idx == word.length) {
            return true;
        }
        if(i < 0 || i >= board.length || j < 0 || j >= board[0].length || word[idx] != board[i][j]) {
            return false;
        }
        board[i][j] = '#';  // mark as visited
        for(int[] dir: DIRS) {
            if(dfs(board, i+dir[0], j+dir[1], word, idx+1)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        board[i][j] = word[idx];  // backtrack here
        return false;
    }
}
```

or 

```java
class Solution {
    private int[][] DIRS = {{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
    public boolean exist(char[][] board, String word) {
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[board.length][board[0].length];
        for(int i=0; i<board.length; i++) {
            for(int j=0; j<board[0].length; j++) {
                if(board[i][j]==word.charAt(0) && exist(board, i, j, word, 0, visited)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    private boolean exist(char[][] board, int i, int j, String word, int idx, boolean[][] visited) {
        if(idx == word.length()) {
            return true;
        }
        if(i<0 || i>=board.length || j<0 || j>=board[0].length || visited[i][j] || board[i][j]!=word.charAt(idx)) {
            return false;
        }
        visited[i][j] = true;
        if(exist(board, i+1, j, word, idx+1, visited) ||
          exist(board, i-1, j, word, idx+1, visited) ||
          exist(board, i, j+1, word, idx+1, visited) ||
          exist(board, i, j-1, word, idx+1, visited)) {
            return true;
        }
        visited[i][j] = false;  // backtrack here
        return false;
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
1. Time Complexity: `(N * 3 ^ L)` where `N` is the number of cells in the board and `L` is the length of the word to be matched.
   * For the backtracking function, initially we could have at most 4 directions to explore, but further the choices are reduced into 3 (since we won't go back to where we come from). As a result, the execution trace after the first step could be visualized as a 3-ary tree, each of the branches represent a potential exploration in the corresponding direction. Therefore, in the worst case, the total number of invocation would be the number of nodes in a full 3-nary tree, which is about `3^L`.
   * We iterate through the board for backtracking, i.e. there could be NNN times invocation for the backtracking function in the worst case. As a result, overall the time complexity of the algorithm would be `(N * 3 ^ L)`.
2. Space Complexity: `O(L)` where `L` is the length of the word to be matched.
   * The main consumption of the memory lies in the recursion call of the backtracking function. 
   * The maximum length of the call stack would be the length of the word. Therefore, the space complexity of the algorithm is `O(L)`.
