> The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the **longest** path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.      
> The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

## Method 1. Depth-First Search

          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5  

helper(null) ==> return 0
helper(4)    ==> return 1
helper(2)    ==> return 2

> Intuition:        
> Any path can be written as two **arrows** (in different directions) from some nodes, where an arrow is a path that starts at some node and only travels down to child nodes.

> 思路是后序遍历 postorder。做法类似104题找二叉树最大深度用到的递归，但是稍微做一点改动。设置一个全局变量记录 res 这个最大长度，递归函数找的依然是最大深度但是 res 记录的是经过当前节点的 diameter。helper 函数往父节点 return 的则是一边的最长长度 + 1 = 一边的最长长度 + 当前这个子节点到父节点的距离。

```java
/**
 dfs(null) = 0
 dfs(leaf) = 1, --> i.e. the number of nodes on this path
    * dfs(4) = 1 since length between 2 and 4 is 1
    * dfs(5) = 1 since length between 2 and 5 is 1
 dfs(2) 
 * Math.max(dfs(4), dfs(5)) + 1
 */
class Solution {
    
    private int res = 0;
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        helper(root);
        return res;
    }
    
    // Defines a helper() function, which returns the number of nodes on the path ended with curr node
    private int helper(TreeNode node) {
        if(node == null) {  // If this node is null, then there is no edge between node and its parent
            return 0;
        }
        int left = helper(node.left);
        int right = helper(node.right);
        res = Math.max(res, left + right);
        return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
1. Time Complexity: `O(N)`. We visit every node once.
2. Space Complexity: `O(N)`, the size of our implicit call stack during our depth-first search.
