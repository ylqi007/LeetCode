[61. Rotate List](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/description/)


## Method 1. My Implementation
let size represent the length of the linked list
1. When k == size, after rotation, the order is the same with the original order
2. When k < size,
   1. splits into two parts, (size - k) and k, moves the last k elements to the head of the first part
   2. fast-->5, slow-->3, i.e. fast is k steps ahead of slow
```java
/**
1. When the length == k, then the linked list keeps the same after rotation
2. When k < length, split the linked list to (length - k) + k. And then combine two sublists together
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode rotateRight(ListNode head, int k) {
        if(head == null || k == 0) {
            return head;
        }
        
        int size = 0;
        ListNode curr = head;
        while(curr != null) {
            size++;
            curr = curr.next;
        }

        k %= size;
        if(k == 0) {
            return head;
        }

        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        for(int i=0; i<k; i++) {
            fast = fast.next;
        }

        while(fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
        }

        ListNode newHead = slow.next;
        slow.next = null;   // split
        fast.next = head;

        return newHead;        
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
1. Time complexity: `O(N)` where N is a number of elements in the list.
2. Space complexity: `O(1)` since it's a constant space solution.
