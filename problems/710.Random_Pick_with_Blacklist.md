## Method 1. 
If we just need to randomly pick up a number from [0, N), we can directly use `Random.nextInt(N)`, and the upper bound (exclusive).
But we have some numbers in blacklist, we need to exclude them. But how can we do this?     
Suppose we have m numbers in blacklist, so we just need to randomly pickup a number between [0, N-m). 
If a num in range [0, N-m) and also in the blacklist, we need to map this num to a number in the range [N-m, N) and also in the whitelist.

* Without blacklist ==> [0, N); with blacklist of length m ==> [0, N-m);

```java 
class Solution {

    private Map<Integer, Integer> memo;
    private Set<Integer> blackSet;
    private Random rand;
    private int range;
    
    public Solution(int N, int[] blacklist) {
        memo = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        blackSet = new HashSet<Integer>();
        rand = new Random();
        
        int m = blacklist.length;   // num of elements in blacklist
        for(int num: blacklist) {   // Record num in the blacklist but out of the range
            if(num >= N - m) {
                blackSet.add(num);
            }
        }
        
        int val = N - m;
        for(int num: blacklist) {   // Map the num in the blacklist and in the range to white value
            if(num < N - m) {
                while(blackSet.contains(val)) {
                    val++;
                }
                memo.put(num, val++);
            }
        }
        range = N - m;
    }
    
    public int pick() {
        int key = rand.nextInt(range);
        return memo.getOrDefault(key, key);
    }
}

/**

```

```java 
N = 4, blacklist = [2]  ==> i.e. Pick a number from [0, 1, 3] randomly.
2 < 4 - 1 == blackSet is empty.
val = N - len = 4 - 1 = 3

```
