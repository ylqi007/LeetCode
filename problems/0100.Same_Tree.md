[100. Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/description/)


## Method 1. Recursion
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSameTree(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(p == null && q == null) {
            return true;
        }
        if(p == null || q == null) {
            return false;
        }
        return p.val == q.val && isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis**
* Time complexity: `O(N)`, where `N` is a number of nodes in the tree, since one visits each node exactly once.
* Space complexity: `O(N)` in the worst case of completely unbalanced tree, to keep a recursion stack.
