## Method 1. Work Backwards
Intuition:
1. If we have a decoded string like `appleappleappleappleappleapple` (i.e. `apple`x6, `apple.length()=5`) and an index like K = 24, the answer is the same if K = 4 (i.e. `k % len = 24 % 5 = 4`).
2. When calculating the length of decoded string:
    1. When the current character is a letter, `size++`
    2. When the current character is a digit, `size x num`
3. When working backwords to find the `k-th` character:
    1. When the current character (e.g. character `s[k]`) is a digit, then the size of decoded string of `s[0, ..., k-1]` is `size /= num` and `k %= size`
    2. When the current character is a letter, `size--` since this character was appended when calcuting the length of decoded string.

```Java
class Solution {
    public String decodeAtIndex(String s, int k) {
        long size = 0;  // 注意此处为long类型，避免overflow
        int N = s.length();

        // Find size = length of decoded string
        for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if(Character.isDigit(c)) {
                size *= (c - '0');
            } else {
                size++;
            }
        }

        for(int i=N-1; i>=0; i--) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            k %= size;
            if(k == 0 && Character.isLetter(c)) {
                return Character.toString(c);
            }
            if(Character.isDigit(c)) {
                size /= (c - '0');
            } else {
                size--;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
1. Time Complexity: `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of `S`.
2. Space Complexity: `O(1)`.


**Note:**
> Why this question is marked with "Stack"? The solution doesn't seems to related to stack...
> 
> I think the concept can be simulated as every time when you encounter a character, you insert that into the "stack"; when you encounter a digit, you "pop" out everything in the stack and do the multiplication. To be honest, "stack" was the first thing came into my mind. [from @geom1try]


## Method 2. Use a Stack
```Java
class Solution {
    public String decodeAtIndex(String s, int k) {
        // Stores the lengths of characters in in the decoded string
        Deque<Long> characterLengths = new ArrayDeque<>();  

        // Calculate lengths of each character in the encoded string
        characterLengths.push(0L);  // Start with 0 length

        for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if(Character.isDigit(c)) {
                // If the character is a digit, update the length based on the current digit
                long length = characterLengths.peek() * (c - '0');
                characterLengths.push(length);
            } else {
                // If the character is a letter, increment the length
                long length = characterLengths.peek() + 1;
                characterLengths.push(length);
            }
        }

        // Traverse the character lengths to decode and find the k-th character
        int len = characterLengths.size();
        while(!characterLengths.isEmpty()) {
            k %= characterLengths.peek();   // Adjust k based on the character length
            len--;
            // If k is 0 and the character is an alphabet letter, return it
            if(Character.isLetter(s.charAt(len-1)) && k == 0) {
                return String.valueOf(s.charAt(len-1));
            }

            // Move to the previous character length
            characterLengths.pop();
        }

        return "";  // Return null if no character is found
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis:**
1. Time complexity: `O(N)`. Since we are iterating over the string twice, one time to calculate decodedLength and another time to get `k-th` character then time complexity is `2*N` which is `O(N)`.
2. Space complexity:` O(N)`. Since we are storing the lengths if each character in a stack then the space complexity is `O(N)`
