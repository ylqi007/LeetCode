## Method 1. Find the Exact Value
```java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        while(left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if(nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            } else if(nums[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
Let `n` be the size of the input array nums.
1. Time complexity: `O(logN)`
    * `nums` is divided into half each time. In the worst-case scenario, we need to cut nums until the range has no element, and it takes logarithmic time to reach this break condition.
2. Space complexity: `O(1)`
   * During the loop, we only need to record three indexes, left, right, and mid, they take constant space.


## Method 2. Find Upper bound
