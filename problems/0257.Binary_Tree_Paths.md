class Solution {
    public List<String> binaryTreePaths(TreeNode root) {
        LinkedList<String> paths = new LinkedList<>();
        constructPaths(root, "", paths);
        return paths;
    }

    private void constructPaths(TreeNode node, String path, LinkedList<String> paths) {
        if(node == null) {
            return;
        }
        path += Integer.toString(node.val);
        if(node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            paths.add(path);
        } else {
            path += "->";   // Extend the current path
            constructPaths(node.left, path, paths);
            constructPaths(node.right, path, paths);
        }
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
1. Time complexity: we visit each node exactly once, thus the time complexity is `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes.
2. Space complexity: `O(N)`. Here we use the space for a **stack call** and for a `paths` list to store the answer. `paths` contains as many elements as leaves in the tree and hence couldn't be larger than `log⁡N` for the trees containing more than one element. Hence the space complexity is determined by a stack call. In the worst case, when the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only one child node, the recursion call would occur `N` times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be `O(N)`. But in the best case (the tree is balanced), the height of the tree would be `log⁡(N)`. Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be `O(log⁡(N))`.

 *         this.right = right;

**Complexity Analysis:**
1. Time complexity: `O(N)` since each node is visited exactly once.
2. Space complexity: `O(N)` as we could keep up to the entire tree.
