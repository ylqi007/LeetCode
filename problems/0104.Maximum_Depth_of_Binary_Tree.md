class Solution {

        }

        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        int depth = 0;  // Initialize depth = 0

        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            depth++;   // The depth of root will be 1
            int size = queue.size();
            for(int i=0; i<size; i++) {

                if(curr.left != null) {
                    queue.offer(curr.left);
                }
                if(curr.right != null) {

**Complexity analysis:**
1. Time complexity: `O(N)`.
2. Space complexity : in the worst case, the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only left child node, the recursion call would occur N times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be `O(N)`. But in the average case (the tree is balanced), the height of the tree would be `log⁡(N)`. Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be `O(log⁡(N))`.


## Method 2. Recursion + DFS (0ms)
终止条件如下
```Java
if(root == null) {
    return 0;
}
```
* **The depth of leaf node is 1**

```java 
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int left = maxDepth(root.left);
        int right = maxDepth(root.right);
        
        return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
    }
}
```
**Complexity analysis:**
1. Time complexity : we visit each node exactly once, thus the time complexity is `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes.
2. Space complexity : in the worst case, the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only left child node, the recursion call would occur `N` times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be `O(N)`. But in the best case (the tree is completely balanced), the height of the tree would be `log⁡(N)`. Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be `O(log⁡(N))`.
