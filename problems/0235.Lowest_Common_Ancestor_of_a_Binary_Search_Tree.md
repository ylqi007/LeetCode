LCA: The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).


Properties of a BST:
1. Left subtree of a node N contains nodes whose values are lesser than or equal to node N's value.
2. Right subtree of a node N contains nodes whose values are greater than node N's value.
3. Both left and right subtrees are also BSTs.


## Method 1. Iterative Approach (5ms, beats 100%)
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        // With early return
        if(root == null) {
            return root;
        }
        while(true) {
            if(p.val < root.val && q.val < root.val) {
                root = root.left;
            } else if(p.val > root.val && q.val > root.val) {
                root = root.right;
            } else {
                return root;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
1. Time Complexity : `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the BST. In the worst case we might be visiting all the nodes of the BST.
2. Space Complexity : `O(1)`. 


## Method 2. Recursive Approach (6ms, beats 38%)
**Algorithm:**
1. Start traversing the tree from the `root` node.
2. If both the nodes `p` and `q` are in the right subtree, then continue the search with right subtree starting step 1.
3. If both the nodes `p` and `q` are in the left subtree, then continue the search with left subtree starting step 1.
4. If both step 2 and step 3 are not true, this means we have found the node which is common to node `p`'s and `q`'s subtrees. And hence we return this common node as the LCA.

思路是**递归(recursion)**，因为BST的性质，所以任何节点的左孩子一定比当前节点小，右孩子一定比当前节点大。
* 如果`root.val`比p，q都大，说明p，q都在`root`的左子树上。
* 如果`root.val`比p，q都小，说明p，q都在`root`的右子树上。
* 否在，p，q分别在`root`的左右子树上，则`root`就是p，q的lowest common ancestor(LCA)。

```Java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(p.val > root.val && q.val > root.val) {
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        } else if(p.val < root.val && q.val < root.val) {
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        } else {
            return root;
        }
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
1. Time Complexity: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the BST. In the worst case we might be visiting all the nodes of the BST.
2. Space Complexity: `O(N)`. This is because the maximum amount of space utilized by the recursion stack would be `N` since the height of a skewed BST could be `N`.


## Method 3. Iterative Approach
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */

class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        
        TreeNode curr = root;
        while(curr != null) {
            if(p.val > curr.val && q.val > curr.val) {
                curr = curr.right;
            } else if(p.val < curr.val && q.val < curr.val) {
                curr = curr.left;
            } else {
                return curr;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

2. Space Complexity : `O(1)`.
