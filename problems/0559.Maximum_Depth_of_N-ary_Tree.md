## Method 1. DFS + Recursion
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(Node root) {
        if(root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        if(root.children.size() == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for(Node child: root.children) {
            max = Math.max(max, maxDepth(child));
        }
        return max + 1;
    }
}
```
**Complexity analysis:**
1. Time complexity : we visit each node exactly once, thus the time complexity is `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes.
2. Space complexity : in the worst case, the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only one child node, the recursion call would occur `N` times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be `O(N)`. But in the best case (the tree is completely balanced), the height of the tree would be `log⁡(N)`. Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be `O(log⁡(N))`.


## Method 2. [Java BFS Iterative Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-n-ary-tree/discuss/183060/Java-BFS-Iterative-Solution)
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(Node root) {
        if(root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        Deque<Node> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        queue.offer(root);
        int depth = 0;
        
        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            for(int i=0; i<size; i++) {
                Node curr = queue.poll();
                for(Node child: curr.children) {
                    queue.offer(child);
                }
            }
            depth++;
        }
        return depth;
    }
}
```
