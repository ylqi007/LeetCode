## Method 1. PriorityQueue
```Java
class Solution {
    public int mostBooked(int n, int[][] meetings) {
        Arrays.sort(meetings, (a, b) -> (a[0] - b[0])); // Sort by start time in natural ordering, i.e. min --> max
        // Sorting by 
        // 1. meeting end time
        // 2. If both have the same end time, then sort according to the room index
        // The PQ is saving all rooms index and when will it become available to use.
        PriorityQueue<long[]> queue = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[0] == b[0] ? (int)(a[1] - b[1]): (int)(a[0] - b[0])); // {endTime, room}

        int[] roomCount = new int[n];   // n is the number of meeting of the room, roomCount[i] represents how many meetings happened in room i
        int res = 0;

        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            queue.add(new long[]{0, i});    // Initially, all meeting rooms end at 0
        }

        for(int[] meeting: meetings) {
            int startTime = meeting[0];
            while(queue.peek()[0] < startTime) {
                queue.add(new long[]{startTime, queue.poll()[1]});
            }

            long[] curr = queue.poll();
            int currRoom = (int)curr[1];
            long meetingEndTime = curr[0] + (meeting[1] - meeting[0]);   // current room endTime + this meeting time
            roomCount[currRoom]++;

            if(roomCount[currRoom] > roomCount[res]) {
                res = currRoom;
            } else if(roomCount[currRoom] == roomCount[res]) {
                res = Math.min(res, currRoom);
            }

            queue.add(new long[]{meetingEndTime, currRoom});
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

Why is there a while-loop?
```Java
while(queue.peek()[0] < startTime) {
    queue.add(new long[]{startTime, queue.poll()[1]});
}
```
The PQ is saving all rooms index and when will it become available to use.
```Java
long[] curr = queue.poll();
int currRoom = (int)curr[1];
long meetingEndTime = curr[0] + (meeting[1] - meeting[0]);   // current room endTime + this meeting time
roomCount[currRoom]++;
```
So just using these line can already keep getting the first available room.

But there are still have one situation will affect the order, when the start time of the input `meeting[0]` is bigger than multiple room end time (mean there are multiple room is available now) we need the get the room with lowest room index, so we get and push all available room with same end time to PQ again and let it order by room index.


## Method 2.
```Java
class Solution {
    public int mostBooked(int n, int[][] meetings) {
        Arrays.sort(meetings, (a, b) -> (a[0] - b[0])); // Sort by meeting start time
        long[] rooms = new long[n]; // rooms[i] represents the avalilable time of room i
        int[] count = new int[n];
        for(int[] meeting: meetings) {
            int startTime = meeting[0];
            int endTime = meeting[1];
            int idx = -1;
            long recent = Long.MAX_VALUE;   // Note: Long type to avoid overflow, if there are thounds of meetings, 
            for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
                // Find the first current available room
                if(startTime >= rooms[i]) {
                    idx = i;
                    break;
                }
                // If there is no available room, find the available room with the earlest time
                if(rooms[i] < recent) {
                    recent = rooms[i];
                    idx = i;
                }
            }
            rooms[idx] = Math.max(endTime, rooms[idx] + endTime - startTime);
            count[idx]++;
        }
        int most = 0;
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if(count[i] > most) {
                most = count[i];
                res = i;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
**Notes:**
1. `long[] rooms = new long[n]`, 这里需要使用`long`类型。如果有`10^5`个meeting，每个meeting都持续`5*10^5`,则最长的时间就是`5*10^10`, which is larger than `Integer.MAX_VALUE`
