    * Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II


**Hints:**
1. Sort meetings based on start times. 根据meetings的开始时间排序。
2. Use two min heaps, the first one keeps track of the numbers of all the rooms that are free, the second heap keeps track of the end times of all the meetings that are happening and the rooms that they are in. 使用两个MinHeap，一个保存当前可用的meeting room，另一个保存正在进行的meeting以及它们所在的meeting rooms。
3. Keep track of the number of times each room is used in an array. 
4. With each meeting, check if there are any free rooms. If there are, then use the room with the lowest number. Otherwise, assign the meeting to the room whose meeting will end the soonest.

## ✅⭐Method 1. PriorityQueue (84ms)
要点：
* 维护每个会议室的 最早可用时间 t。每次安排会议[start,end)时，将那些 t 早于 start 的会议室的 t 设为 start。这样处理后只需从中选择 t 最早的会议室即可（如果有相等的选下标最小的）。

```Java
class Solution {
    public int mostBooked(int n, int[][] meetings) {
        Arrays.sort(meetings, (a, b) -> (a[0] - b[0])); // Sort by start time in natural ordering, i.e. min --> max
        // Sorting by 
        // 1. meeting end time
        // 2. If both have the same end time, then sort according to the room index
        // The PQ is saving all rooms index and when will it become available to use.
        PriorityQueue<long[]> queue = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[0] == b[0] ? (int)(a[1] - b[1]): (int)(a[0] - b[0])); // {endTime, room}

        int[] roomCount = new int[n];   // n is the number of meeting of the room, roomCount[i] represents how many meetings happened in room i
        int res = 0;

        // a[0] time, available time of room id
        // a[1] room id
        // Sort by time first, then room id
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            queue.add(new long[]{0, i});    // Initially, all meeting rooms end at 0
        }

        for(int[] meeting: meetings) {
            int startTime = meeting[0];
            // Move used rooms with availability time < current meeting start time into queue, which these rooms could used by the current meeting
            while(queue.peek()[0] < startTime) {    // It must be "<" here. "<=" will cause TLE
                queue.add(new long[]{startTime, queue.poll()[1]});
            }

            long[] curr = queue.poll();
            int currRoom = (int)curr[1];
            long meetingEndTime = curr[0] + (meeting[1] - meeting[0]);   // current room endTime + this meeting time
            roomCount[currRoom]++;

            if(roomCount[currRoom] > roomCount[res]) {
                res = currRoom;
            } else if(roomCount[currRoom] == roomCount[res]) {
                res = Math.min(res, currRoom);
            }

            queue.add(new long[]{meetingEndTime, currRoom});
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
or
```java
class Solution {
    public int mostBooked(int n, int[][] meetings) {
        Arrays.sort(meetings, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);   // Sort by start time

        // {availableTime, roomId}
        // Order by available time first, then by roomId
        PriorityQueue<long[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[0] != b[0] ? Long.compare(a[0], b[0]) : Long.compare(a[1], b[1]));
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            pq.offer(new long[]{0, i}); // At time 0, all rooms are available
        }

        int[] count = new int[n];
        int res = 0;
        for(int[] meeting: meetings) {
            int startTime = meeting[0];
            int endTime = meeting[1];
            while(pq.peek()[0] < startTime) {
                pq.offer(new long[]{startTime, pq.poll()[1]});  // Update available time
            }

            long[] currRoom = pq.poll();
            int roomId = (int)currRoom[1];
            pq.offer(new long[]{Math.max(endTime, currRoom[0] + endTime - startTime), currRoom[1]});
            
            count[roomId]++;
            if(count[roomId] > count[res]) {
                res = roomId;
            } else if(count[roomId] == count[res] && roomId < res) {
                res = roomId;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

Why is there a while-loop?
```Java
while(queue.peek()[0] < startTime) {
    queue.add(new long[]{startTime, queue.poll()[1]});
}
```
The PQ is saving all rooms index and when will it become available to use.
```Java
long[] curr = queue.poll();
int currRoom = (int)curr[1];
long meetingEndTime = curr[0] + (meeting[1] - meeting[0]);   // current room endTime + this meeting time
roomCount[currRoom]++;
```
So just using these line can already keep getting the first available room.

But there are still have one situation will affect the order, when the start time of the input `meeting[0]` is bigger than multiple room end time (mean there are multiple room is available now) we need the get the room with lowest room index, so we get and push all available room with same end time to PQ again and let it order by room index.


## Method 2.
```Java
class Solution {
    public int mostBooked(int n, int[][] meetings) {
        Arrays.sort(meetings, (a, b) -> (a[0] - b[0])); // Sort by meeting start time
        long[] rooms = new long[n]; // rooms[i] represents the avalilable time of room i
        int[] count = new int[n];
        for(int[] meeting: meetings) {
            int startTime = meeting[0];
            int endTime = meeting[1];
            int idx = -1;
            long recent = Long.MAX_VALUE;   // Note: Long type to avoid overflow, if there are thounds of meetings, 
            for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
                // Find the first current available room
                if(startTime >= rooms[i]) {
                    idx = i;
                    break;
                }
                // If there is no available room, find the available room with the earlest time
                if(rooms[i] < recent) {
                    recent = rooms[i];
                    idx = i;
                }
            }
            rooms[idx] = Math.max(endTime, rooms[idx] + endTime - startTime);
            count[idx]++;
        }
        int most = 0;
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if(count[i] > most) {
                most = count[i];
                res = i;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
**Notes:**
1. `long[] rooms = new long[n]`, 这里需要使用`long`类型。如果有`10^5`个meeting，每个meeting都持续`5*10^5`,则最长的时间就是`5*10^10`, which is larger than `Integer.MAX_VALUE`

## Method 3. From Editorial (73ms)
**Algorithm:**
1. Create two priority queues, `unusedRooms` and `usedRooms`, representing the available rooms and currently used rooms, respectively. Create an array `meetingCount` of size `n` to keep track of the number of meetings held in each room. 
2. Use the `heapify` function to convert `unsedRooms` into a min heap, ensuring the room with the lowest room number is at the top. 即定义`PriorityQueue`内部的排序方式。
3. Itrate through the meetings sorted by start time. 
4. While there are used rooms (`usedRooms`) and the first room's meeting has already concluded (meeting end time <= current meeting start time), remove the room from `usedRooms` and add it back to `unusedRooms`.
5. Check if there are available rooms (`unusedRooms`). If available, pop the room with the lowest number from `unusedRooms` and allocate the meeting to that room. Update `usedRooms` with the meeting end time and the room number.
6. If no available room, pop the room with the earliest availability time from `usedRooms`. Ajust the availability time for the room to accommodate the delayed meeting. Update `usedRooms` with the meeting end time and the room number.
7. Increase the meeting count for the allocated roome. 
8. After processing all meetings, return the index of the room with the maximum meeting count. If there are multiple rooms with the same maximum meeting count, return the room with the lowest index.

```Java
class Solution {
    public int mostBooked(int n, int[][] meetings) {
         
        // Unused rooms, the room with the lowest room number will be poll first
        PriorityQueue<Integer> unusedRooms = new PriorityQueue<>();
        // Used rooms, sort by available time and room number
        // a[0] == b[0] means that if both rooms are available at the same time, then sort by room number
        PriorityQueue<long[]> usedRooms = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[0]==b[0] ? Long.compare(a[1], b[1]): Long.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        int[] meetingCount = new int[n];
        int res = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            unusedRooms.offer(i);
        }

        // Sorting meetings according to start time
        Arrays.sort(meetings, (a, b) -> a[0] != b[0] ? Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]) : Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));

        for(int[] meeting: meetings) {
            int start = meeting[0];
            int end = meeting[1];

            while(!usedRooms.isEmpty() && usedRooms.peek()[0] <= start) {
                int room = (int)usedRooms.poll()[1];
                unusedRooms.offer(room);
            }

            if(!unusedRooms.isEmpty()) {
                int room = unusedRooms.poll();
                usedRooms.offer(new long[]{end, room});
                meetingCount[room]++;
            } else {
                long roomAvailableTime = usedRooms.peek()[0];
                int room = (int)usedRooms.poll()[1];
                usedRooms.offer(new long[]{roomAvailableTime + end - start, room});
                meetingCount[room]++;
            }
        }

        int maxMeetingCount = 0;
        int maxMeetingCountRoom = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if(meetingCount[i] > maxMeetingCount) {
                maxMeetingCount = meetingCount[i];
                maxMeetingCountRoom = i;
            }
        }
        return maxMeetingCountRoom;
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:** Let `N` be the number of rooms. Let `M` be the number of meetings.
1. Time complexity: `O(M⋅logM+M⋅logN)`. 
    * Sorting meetings will incur a time complexity of `O(M⋅logM)`. 
    * Popping and pushing into the priority queue will each cost `O(logN)`. These priority queue operations run inside a for loop that runs at most `M` times leading to a time complexity of `O(M⋅logN)`.
    * The inner nested loop will incur a time complexity of `O(logN)`. The combined time complexity will be `O(M⋅logM+M⋅logN)`. As per the constraints `N` is small, the term `O(M⋅logM)` will dominate.
    * Note: Initializing `unused_rooms` will cost `O(N)` in ruby and python. But will cost `O(N⋅logN)` in C++ and Java due to the implementation.
2. Space complexity: `O(N+sort)`. Initializing `unused_rooms` and `meeting_count` will incur a space complexity of `O(N)`. Some extra space is used when we sort an array of size `N` in place. The space complexity of the **sorting algorithm** depends on the programming language.
    * In Python, the sort method sorts a list using the Timsort algorithm which is a combination of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort and has a space complexity of `O(N)`.
    * In C++, the `sort()` function is implemented as a hybrid of Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort, with a worst-case space complexity of `O(log⁡N)`.
    * In Java, Arrays.sort() is implemented using a variant of the Quick Sort algorithm which has a space complexity of `O(log⁡N)`.
