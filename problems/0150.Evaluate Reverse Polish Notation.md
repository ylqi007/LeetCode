## Key Points
1. Reverse Polish Notation is not a **reverse** form of Polish Notation. It is a bit different.
2. When the input type is an array of strings, not an array of chars, we should be comparing them with `.equals(...)`, not `==`.
3. **Some programming languages** (e.g. Python, but not C++ and Java) do not truncate towards 0 with division, so you'll need to figure out how to make them do so.
4. Did you put numbers around the correct way? e.g. the test case ["12", "7", "-"] means you should calculate `12 - 7 = 5`, and not `7 - 12 = -5`.

## Division between two integers should truncate towards zero
1. When dividing 2 positive numbers, we always truncate down to the nearest integer. For example, `9 / 5 = 1 (1.8)`
    1. The result is truncated to a **less than or equal number**, i.e. `1` is less than `1.8`;
    2. The truncation is towards zero, i.e. `1` is closer to zero than `1.8` is.
2. For negative numbers, however, it is **impossible** to satisfy both of these, so one or the other has to be picked. For example, `-9 / 5 = ? (-1.8)`
    1. If we want the truncated result to be **smaller**, we'd have to go to `-2`, as `-2 < -1`;
    2. If we want the truncated result to be **nearer to zero**, we'd have to go to `-1` as `-1` is nearer to zero than `-2` is.
   
    Some programming languages go with the first definition, and others go with the second. 

## What is Infix Notation(中缀符号)?

## What is Reverse Polish Notation?
> While there are operations remaining in the list, find the left-most operator. Apply it to the 2 numbers immediately before it,
> and replace all 3 tokens (the operator and 2 numbers) with the result.
>
> For example in the simplest case of `3 4 +` when we reach `+`, we can replace `3 4 + ` with its result `7`.

## Method 1. Stack
```java
class Solution {
    public int evalRPN(String[] tokens) {
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();

        for(String token: tokens) {
            if("+".equals(token)) {
                int num2 = stack.pop();
                int num1 = stack.pop();
                stack.push(num1 + num2);
            } else if("-".equals(token)) {
                int num2 = stack.pop();
                int num1 = stack.pop();
                stack.push(num1 - num2);
            } else if("*".equals(token)) {
                int num2 = stack.pop();
                int num1 = stack.pop();
                stack.push(num1 * num2);
            } else if("/".equals(token)) {
                int num2 = stack.pop();
                int num1 = stack.pop();
                stack.push(num1 / num2);
            } else {
                stack.push(Integer.valueOf(token));
            }
        }
        return stack.pop();
    }
}
```

    
## Method 1. Reducing the List In-place
> A pointer is used to step through the list, and each time an operator (`+ - * /`) is found, the operator is then applied to the 2 values before it (which are always numbers, as long as the original input was valid).
> The 3 values are then replaced with the result.
> This process is replaced until the list of length 1, containing a single number that is the answer to be returned.
```Java
class Solution {
    private static final Map<String, BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer>> OPERATIONS = new HashMap<>();
    // Ensure this only gets done once for all test cases
    static {
        OPERATIONS.put("+", (a, b) -> a + b);
        OPERATIONS.put("-", (a, b) -> a - b);
        OPERATIONS.put("*", (a, b) -> a * b);
        OPERATIONS.put("/", (a, b) -> a / b);
    }

    public int evalRPN(String[] tokens) {
        int idx = 0;
        int len = tokens.length;

        while(len > 1) {
            // 1. Move the idx to the next operator
            while(!OPERATIONS.containsKey(tokens[idx])) {
                idx++;
            }

            // 2. Extract the operator and numbers to apply operation
            String operator = tokens[idx];
            int num1 = Integer.parseInt(tokens[idx - 2]);
            int num2 = Integer.parseInt(tokens[idx - 1]);

            // 3. Calculate the result to override the operator with
            int value = OPERATIONS.get(operator).apply(num1, num2);
            tokens[idx] = Integer.toString(value);

            // 4. Delete numbers and point pointers correctly
            delete2AtIndex(tokens, idx-2, len);
            idx--;
            len -= 2;
        }
        return Integer.parseInt(tokens[0]);
    }

    private void delete2AtIndex(String[] tokens, int d, int length) {
        for(int i=d; i<length-2; i++) {
            tokens[i] = tokens[i+2];
        }
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
1. Time Complexity : `O(n^2)`, where `n` be the length of the list.
2. Space Complexity : `O(1)`. The only extra space used is a constant number of single-value variables. Therefore, the overall algorithm requires `O(1)` space.


## Method 2. Evaluate with Stack
### 2.1 With BiFunction
```Java
class Solution {
    private static final Map<String, BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer>> OPERATIONS = new HashMap<>();
    // Ensure this only gets done once for all test cases
    static {
        OPERATIONS.put("+", (a, b) -> a + b);
        OPERATIONS.put("-", (a, b) -> a - b);
        OPERATIONS.put("*", (a, b) -> a * b);
        OPERATIONS.put("/", (a, b) -> a / b);
    }

    public int evalRPN(String[] tokens) {
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        
        for(String token: tokens) {
            if(!OPERATIONS.containsKey(token)) {
                stack.push(Integer.valueOf(token));
                continue;
            }

            int num2 = stack.pop();
            int num1 = stack.pop();
            int result = OPERATIONS.get(token).apply(num1, num2);
            stack.push(result);
        }
        
        return stack.pop();
    }
}
```

### 2.2 Without `lambda`
```java 
class Solution {
    public int evalRPN(String[] tokens) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
        for(String s: tokens) {
            switch(s) {
                case "+":
                    stack.push(stack.pop() + stack.pop());
                    break;
                case "-":
                    stack.push(-stack.pop() + stack.pop());
                    break;
                case "*":
                    stack.push(stack.pop() * stack.pop());
                    break;
                case "/":
                    int n2 = stack.pop();
                    int n1 = stack.pop();
                    stack.push(n1 / n2);
                    break;
                default:
                    stack.push(Integer.parseInt(s));
            }
        }
        return stack.pop();
    }
}
```
**Complexity Analysis:**
1. Time Complexity : `O(n)`, where Let `n` be the length of the list.
    We do a linear search to put all numbers on the stack, and process all operators. Processing an operator requires removing 2 numbers off the stack and replacing them with a single number, which is an `O(1)` operation. Therefore, the total cost is proportional to the length of the input array. Unlike before, we're no longer doing expensive deletes from the middle of an Array or List.
2. Space Complexity : `O(n)`. In the worst case, the stack will have all the numbers on it at the same time. This is never more than half the length of the input array.



## Method 3. Evaluate using stack based on array
```java 
class Solution {
    public int evalRPN(String[] tokens) {
        int[] nums = new int[tokens.length / 2 + 1];
        int idx = 0;
        for(String s: tokens) {
            switch(s) {
                case "+":
                    nums[idx-2] = nums[idx-2] + nums[idx-1];
                    idx--;  // The value at position idx-1 should be replaced.
                    break;
                case "-":
                    nums[idx-2] -= nums[idx-1];
                    idx--;
                    break;
                case "*":
                    nums[idx-2] *= nums[idx-1];
                    idx--;
                    break;
                case "/":
                    nums[idx-2] /= nums[idx-1];
                    idx--;
                    break;
                default:
                    nums[idx++] = Integer.parseInt(s);
                    break;
            }
        }
        return nums[0];
    }
}
```
