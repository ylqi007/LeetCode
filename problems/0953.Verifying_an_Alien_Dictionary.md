## Method 1. Hash Table (0ms, beats 100%)
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isAlienSorted(String[] words, String order) {
        int[] orderMap = new int[26];
        for(int i=0; i<order.length(); i++) {
            orderMap[order.charAt(i)-'a'] = i;
        }

        for(int i=0; i<words.length-1; i++) {
            for(int j=0; j<words[i].length(); j++) {
                // If we do not find a mismatch letter between words[i] and words[i+1]
                // we need to examine the case when words are like ("apple", "app")
                if(j >= words[i+1].length()) {
                    return false; 
                }

                if(words[i].charAt(j) != words[i+1].charAt(j)) {
                    int currWordChar = words[i].charAt(j) - 'a';
                    int nextWordChar = words[i+1].charAt(j) - 'a';

                    if(orderMap[currWordChar] > orderMap[nextWordChar]) {
                        return false;
                    } else {
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
**Complexity analysis:**
Let `N` be the length of `order`, and `M` be the total number of characters in `words`.
1. Time complexity: `O(M)`.
    * Storing the `letter-order` relation of each letter takes `O(N)` time. 
    * For the nested for-loops, we examine each pair of words in the outer-loop and for the inner loop, we check each letter in the current word. Therefore, we will iterate over all of letters in words.
    * Taking both into consideration, the time complexity is `O(M+N)`. However, we know that NNN is fixed as 26. Therefore, the time complexity is `O(M)`.
2. Space complexity: `O(1)`.
    * The only extra data structure we use is the hashmap/array that serves to store the letter-order relations for each word in order. Because the length of order is fixed as 26, this approach achieves constant space complexity.
