* Hint: Beware of overflow when you reverse the integer.


## Analysis

* First of all, we should take care of some edge cases. All negative numbers are not palindrome, so we can return false for all negative numbers.
* Reverse the last half of the number.


## Method 1. Reverse half of the number

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        // Special cases:
        // When x < 0, x is not a palindrome. Also if the last digit of the number is 0, in order to be a palindrome,
        // the first digit of the number also needs to be 0, and only 0 satisfy this property.
        if(x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0)) {
            return false;
        }
        
        int reversedNumber = 0;
        while(x > reversedNumber) {     // x > reverseNumber, not x > 0
            reversedNumber = reversedNumber * 10 + x % 10;
            x = x / 10;
        }
        
        // When the length is an odd number, we can get rid of the middle digit by reversedNumber/10
        // Since the middle digit doesn't matter in palindrome(it will always equal to itself), 
        // we can simply get rid of it.
        return x == reversedNumber || x == reversedNumber/10;
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity : `O(log⁡10(n))`. We divided the input by 10 for every iteration, so the time complexity is `O(log⁡10(n))`.
- Space complexity : `O(1)`.
