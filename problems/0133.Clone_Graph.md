## Method 1. Depth First Search (24ms, beats 92%)
Algorithm:
1. Start traversing the graph from the given node.
2. We would take a hash map to store the reference of the copy of all the nodes that have already been visited and cloned.
3. If we don't find the node in the `visited` hash map, we create a copy of it and put it in the hash map. 
Note, how it's important to create a copy of the node and add to the hash map before entering recursion.            
In the absence of such an ordering, we would be caught in the recursion because on encountering the node again in somewhere down the recursion again, we will be traversing it again thus getting into cycle.
4. Now make the recursive call for the neighbors of the given `node`.

上述 Algorithm 中的要点：
1. 必须要有一种方式标记已经访问过的 Node，否则会造成循环。比如说 `A -- B`，因为是无向图，所以当克隆 A’ 的时候，A‘ 要克隆 B’，B‘ 又要克隆 A’。。。
2. 要先将 cloned node 标记为 visited，然后再 clone node‘s list 中的 nodes，否则也会造成 死循环。

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
    
    public Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    
    public Node(int _val, ArrayList<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
}
*/

class Solution {
    private HashMap<Node, Node> visited = new HashMap<>();
    
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if(node == null) {
            return node;
        }
        
        // If the node was already visited before, return the cloned node from the vsited dictionary.
        if(visited.containsKey(node)) {
            return visited.get(node);
        }
        
        // Create a clone for the given node. Note that we don't have cloned neighbors as of now, hence [].
        Node cloneNode = new Node(node.val, new ArrayList<Node>());
        // The key is original node and value being the cloned node.
        visited.put(node, cloneNode);
        
        // Iterate through the neighbors to generate their clones
        // and prepare a list of cloned neighbors to be added to the cloned node.
        for(Node nei: node.neighbors) {
            cloneNode.neighbors.add(cloneGraph(nei));
        }
        return cloneNode;
    }
}
```
> Tip: Recursion could get a bit cumbersome to graph, if you try to get into every call yourself and try to see what's happening.
> And why look at every call when every call does the same thing with different inputs. 
> So, you just worry about ONE such call and let the recursion do the rest.

**Complexity Analysis:**
1. Time Complexity: `O(N)` since we process each node exactly once.
2. Space Complexity: `O(N)`. This space is occupied by the visited hash map and in addition to that, space would also be occupied by the recursion stack since we are adopting a recursive approach here. The space occupied by the recursion stack would be equal to O(H) where H is the height of the graph. Overall, the space complexity would be O(N).

/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
    
    public Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    
    public Node(int _val, ArrayList<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
}
*/

class Solution {
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if(node == null) {
            return null;
        }
        
        Map<Node, Node> map = new HashMap<Node, Node>();
        return cloneGraph(node, map);
    }
    
    private Node cloneGraph(Node node, Map<Node, Node> map) {
        if(node == null) {
            return null;
        }
        if(map.containsKey(node)) {
            return map.get(node);
        }
        Node cloned = new Node(node.val);
        map.put(node, cloned);
        for(Node n: node.neighbors) {
            cloned.neighbors.add(cloneGraph(n, map));
        }
        return cloned;
    }
}

## Method 2. Breadth First Search (slow)
Algorithm:
1. We will use a hash map to store the reference of the copy of all the nodes that have already been visited and copied. 
2. Add the first node to the queue. Clone the first node and add it to `visited` hash map.
3. Do the BFS traversal:
    * Pop a node from the front of the queue;
    * Visit all the neighbors of this node;
    * If any of the neighbors was already visited then it must be present in the `visited` dictionary. Get the clone of this neighbor from `visited` in that case.
    * Otherwise, create a clone and store in the `visited`;
    * Add the clones of the neighbors to the corresponding list of the clone node.
    
```java 
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
    
    public Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    
    public Node(int _val, ArrayList<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
}
*/

class Solution {
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if(node == null) {
            return null;
        }
        
        // Hash map to save the visited node and its respective clone as key and value respectively.
        // This helps to avoid cycles.
        Map<Node, Node> visited = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Put the first node in the queue.
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<Node>();
        queue.add(node);
        // Clone the node and put it in the visited dictionary.
        visited.put(node, new Node(node.val, new ArrayList<Node>()));
        
        // Start BFS traversal
        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            // Pop a node from the front of the queue.
            Node n = queue.remove();
            // Iterate through all the neighbors of the node `n`
            for(Node nei: n.neighbors) {
                if(!visited.containsKey(nei)) {
                    visited.put(nei, new Node(nei.val, new ArrayList<Node>()));
                    queue.add(nei);
                }
                // Add the clone of the neighbor to the neighbors of the clone node `n`
                visited.get(n).neighbors.add(visited.get(nei));
            }
        }
        // Return the clone of the node from visited.
        return visited.get(node);
    }
}
```


Complexity Analysis

    Time Complexity : O(N) since we process each node exactly once.

    Space Complexity : O(N). This space is occupied by the visited dictionary and in addition to that, space would also be occupied by the queue since we are adopting the BFS approach here. The space occupied by the queue would be equal to O(W) where W is the width of the graph. Overall, the space complexity would be O(N). 



## 分析
既然是克隆/复制一个数据结构，一定涉及到两点，一是遍历，二是记录。图的遍历无非就是 BFS 或者 DFS，记录基本都会用到 hashmap，除了链表的复制也许可以不需要用到 hashmap，因为可以把复制出来的节点加在原节点之后。参见138题。
