## Method 1. One Pass -- My Solution
Intuition:
* 由于可以多次买卖，为了 max profit，考虑每一次可能的利润。也就是，当 `prices[i-1] < prices[i]` 的时候，收割利润。
* 当 `prices[i-1] > prices[i]` 的时候，说明无法获得利润，只能更新当前 min price。
* 由于 `minPrice = prices[i]`
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        int minPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int i=0; i<prices.length; i++) {
            if(prices[i] < minPrice) {
                minPrice = prices[i];
            } else {    // prices[i] >= minPrice
                profit += (prices[i] - minPrice);
                minPrice = prices[i];
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
```

## Method 1. One Pass
Intuition:
* Get every possible profit, i.e. when `prices[i-1] < prices[i]`, add the profit.

Key Ponits:
> On the other hand, if one can make as many transactions as one would like, then in order to gain the maximal profits, 
> one must capture each augmentation and avoid each plunging of stock price.

Specifically, given a list of prices, for any two adjacent time points with stock prices p1 and p2, the above best 
strategies can be broke down into the following two cases:
* If later the price augments, i.e. `p2 > p1`, then a good trader should buy at `p1` and then sell at `p2`, seizing this moment to make profits.
* If later the price stays the same or even plunges, i.e. `p2 <= p1`, then a good trader should just hold the money in the pocket, 
neither to buy nor sell any stock.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        for(int i=1; i<prices.length; i++) {
            if(prices[i] > prices[i-1]) {
                profit += (prices[i] - prices[i-1]);
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis
1. Time complexity : O(n). Single pass.
2. Space complexity: O(1). Constant space needed.


## Method 2. Peak Valley Approach
![](images/122_maxprofit_1.PNG)
* `TotalProfit = Sum(height(peak_i) - height(valley_i))`
Key Points:
1. `while(i < prices.length - 1)`, if `i < prices.length`, then this will fall into dead-loop.
2. Always compare to the next value to find peak and valley.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        int valley = prices[0];
        int peak = prices[0];
        int i = 0;
        while(i < prices.length - 1) {
            while(i < prices.length - 1 && prices[i] >= prices[i+1]) {
                i++;
            }   // after the while-loop, prices[i] >= prices[i+1]
            valley = prices[i];
            while(i < prices.length - 1 && prices[i] <= prices[i+1]) {
                i++;
            }   // after the while-loop, prices[i] > prices[i+1]
            peak = prices[i];
            profit += (peak - valley);
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
```
